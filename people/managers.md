# People Management 
With the exception of the Executive Director, each team member has a manager whoâ€™s responsible for clarifying 2i2c expectations and supporting the person so they can be successful in their role. 

## Templates and processes
We maintain a collection of people management templates and processes, available to team members only. Team members can find templates in the [People Management Templates and Processes](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18lBLg9UdFL8Bf-3QWoRz41nuULUZNoAo?usp=drive_link) folder in Google Drive.

Those templates support managers in onboarding new team members, structuring regular check in meetings to discuss both the person and their work, giving feedback, managing performance, and supporting team member development.
