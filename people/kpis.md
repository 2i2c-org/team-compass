# KPIs for People 

We know our People practices are working when we see the following Key Performance Indicators at healthy levels.

## Healthy team function - well-being and engagement

### Positive team engagement 
Engagement is a broad category of things that touches on motivation, connection and well-being at work. At least once a year, we complete a team engagement survey. That survey is based on questions from benchmarking organizations, and 2i2c team members can review the detailed survey design and follow up actions on [the People Operations Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1JK9f7tF9s4BKW8gNLIDoNLFuV979nkzy). 

Here are our last survey results from April 2025. Our target, what we'd consider "good" scores for each, is 70%. A lower score means we want to take action to improve.

"Category", "Response", "Description"
"Well-being", "73%", "are we feeling good?"
"Leadership", "76%", "are leaders inspiring and supporting each other and the team?"
"Enablement", "67%", "does each of us have what they need to be successful?"
"Alignment", "70%", "do we all understand our roles and the vision for 2i2c?"
"Development", "55%", "does each person feel like they're growing?"
"Relationships", "90%", "are we safe & supportive?"
```

### Meeting targets for time off 
We want all team members to have a comfortable integration of work and rest. Time off is one of many factors that support that integration, and taking enough time off is a leading indicator of team well-being & burnout avoidance. 

We track our time off via GitHub, and make those metrics available to the 2i2c team on our [People KPIs tracker](https://2i2c.org/kpis/people/). When people take less than a week off per quarter, we gently pressure them to schedule time away from work. 

### Team member onboarding effectiveness (time to first PR, etc)
We don't currently measure this, given the size of our team and our rate of scaling.

## Reduce or avoid capability gaps in teams
We also measure People process effectiveness based on how well our teams are staffed to meet the needs of our communities. We don't currently track specific data in this area yet, but do some vibes-based assessment.

### Critical roles are staffed
When we hire, we measure time-to-hire with the intention of identifying, describing, recruiting for and hiring within 90 days. 

### Teams have the capacity needed to function effectively
Our teams are small, and we aim to have a good distribution of capacity (time and skill) to accomplish each team's goals.

### People are growing in ways that support our organizational direction
This is a broad assessment across everyone's development plans and progression. We strive to balance each person's areas of interest and skill with the organization's needs.
