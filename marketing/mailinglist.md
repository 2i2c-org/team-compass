# Mailing list

We use [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) for our mailing list.

See [](./strategy.md) for how our mailing list fits into our communications strategy.

## Access Mailchimp

We have a single Mailchimp account and share access to team members via a single `username`/`password`.
See [](account:bitwarden) for access.

## Send e-mails via Mailchimp

Mailchimp is a little complex for our needs, as it is a full community management and communications service.
However, it is still the simplest solution out there so here's a quick guide on how to use it.

Mailchimp calls each e-mail a **Campaign**.

**To see our preview e-mails**: Click {guilabel}`Campaigns` -> {guilabel}`All campaigns`. You'll see a list of the previous e-mails we've sent to our communities via Mailchimp.

**To create a new e-mail**: The simplest approach is to **replicate a previous campaign**. Go to the list of previous campaigns (see above), click the `v` next to the latest one, and click on {guilabel}`Replicate`. This will give you a pre-filled template with the same layout we've used before. Replace the content as you wish before sending.

Send new campaigns as your personal e-mail address (if you wish to identify personally with the e-mail), or with `hello@2i2c.org`.

## Our contact list

Users sign up to the newsletter via our landing page's contact form at [2i2c.org#contact](https://2i2c.org#contact).

**Do not manually add e-mail addresses** unless you know somebody wants to be on this list.
