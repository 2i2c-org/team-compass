# Communications workflow

Here's our basic workflow:

- Create a GitHub issue [from our github issue template](#blog:template).
- [Write a blog post](#blog:write) using that issue. Keep is simple and quick.
- [Schedule a social media post](./social.md) to signal-boost it.
- Write a [monthly mailing list post](./mailinglist.md) summarizing the highlights.

## Communication channels

### Blog

Use our blog as the central place of communication. This gives us a space that we control to tell our story. Our blog should be a running record of our learning and impact, no matter how small.

On our blog, we communicate frequently in low-cost ways. 

- **Lean into imperfect and in-progress effort.** This provides organizational transparency and leans into open ways of working.
- **Communicate any time we learn something.** Use this to show what we're working on along the way.
- **Communicate any time a community does something useful.** Use this to highlight the impact communities have, enabled by 2i2c.
- **Share attribution with collaborators, funders, and members.** Use this to lean into co-creation and collective impact.

### Social media

Use social media as a rapid and low-effort way to signal-boost our blog.
Auto-schedule posts on social media channels for any blog post, but don't put too much effort into this.

### Mailing list

Use our mailing list as a way of directing attention to our blog and providing high-importance calls to action.

On our mailing list, we communicate infrequently, highlight interesting updates, and expect readers to click-through for more information.

### Conferences and talks

Use talks to grow 2i2c's brand according to [](#brand:ideas), to create content for our blog, and to generate potential leads for sales or feedback.

- **Remote / virtual** talks: accept these as you wish.
- **In-person** talks and conferences: Give a rationale and get approval from a team leadbefore deciding to attend.

Unique talks should also be blog posts. This gives us more discoverable and persistent content we can link to.

Any talk should turn into a blog post! Ideally with a link to the blog-version of the content.

See [](#talks:prioritize) for guidelines about what kind of content opportunities are best for 2i2c.

## Outreach strategy

- Use social media for the steady trickle of updates from our blog.
- Share our periodic "index-style" posts with:
  - Our mailing list.
  - Our Slack channel, and any shared channels with collaborators.
  - Communications spaces for key collaborator communities (e.g., the Jupyter forum).
