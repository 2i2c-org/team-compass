# Social media

We use social media to signal boost and broadcast 2i2c's impact to the broader community.
Currently, we do not have a dedicated Social Media manager, so the responsibility for managing these accounts is spread amongst the team.

(socialmedia:topics)=
## What to post on social media

We currently only use social media for two things:

- Signal-boosting [our blog posts](./blog.md).
- Signal-boosting major calls to action for ourselves or others.

(social:buffer)=
## Buffer for scheduling posts

Use this to post and schedule across [our social media channels](#social:accounts).

**How to access**: See [](account:bitwarden).

(social:accounts)=
## List of our social media accounts

We use the following accounts for social media.

(social:bluesky)=
### BlueSky

Our BlueSky handle is [@2i2c.org](https://bsky.app/profile/2i2c.org).
Currently, there is nobody actively monitoring the BlueSky account.

**How to access**: See [](account:bitwarden).

(social:mastodon)=
### Mastodon

Our Mastodon handle is ([@2i2c_org](https://hachyderm.io/@2i2c_org)).
Currently, there is nobody actively monitoring the Mastodon account.

**How to access**: See [](account:bitwarden).

(social:linkedin)=
### LinkedIn

Here is [our LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/70495902/).
We use LinkedIn roughly the same way that we use Bluesky, though focus it more on signal-boosting blog posts and updates because fewer team members regularly use LinkedIn.

**How to access**: We can add **page admins** to our LinkedIn account, which gives others the ability to manage the account and post content.
If you'd like to be added, ask one of [the pre-existing account admins](https://www.linkedin.com/company/70495902/admin/manage-admins/).


(social:twitter)=
### Twitter / X

_We do not currently use Twitter/X, but leave this here for reference_

Our Twitter handle is ([@2i2c_org](https://twitter.com/2i2c_org)).
Currently, there is nobody actively monitoring the Twitter account.

**How to access**: See [](account:bitwarden).
