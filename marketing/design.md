# Design, images, and videos

There are several design and images assets that we use in our websites and online materials.
For example, logos, banners, images for GitHub Teams, etc.

## Figma for images

Almost all of our design assets [exist in this Figma board](https://www.figma.com/file/pp9e4cNYthJnm8u6MzpUdp/Logo-and-brand-assets?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=B2tDcpyIUmfnazdk-1).
Any team member should be able to access it and re-use assets as you wish.

This uses [Figma's free plan](https://www.figma.com/pricing/) and so only the owner of a board (`@choldgraf` in this case) can make edits.
It is `read-only` for all others.

If enough team members want to make edits on their own, then we should consider upgrading to a professional plan.

## Google Drive for design assets

We store some assets on Google Drive, such as diagrams that we use in our documentation.
Much of this is [in the `Outreach and Marketing/Media` folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YJVBCXFYHXo-xcfHo63WdinnNRETisE2?usp=share_link).

## `screen.studio` for screencasts

The [`screen.studio`](https://screen.studio) tool is useful for recording high-quality screencasts of demonstrations.
It is used to create movies and GIFs like the ones we share on [2i2c.org/platform](https://2i2c.org/platform).

We have **three device slots for `screen.studio`**, and a single activation key that activates a device for one of the slots.
A list of active slots and the key for adding a new device is in [our team BitWarden account](#account:bitwarden).
