# Printing stickers

2i2c has a [stickerninja account](https://stickerninja.com/) that can be used to purchase stickers.
The username and password for the account are in our [team Bitwarden account](account:bitwarden).

You can find designs meant for printing stickers in the stickers section of [our Figma design board](design:figma).
Look for the `stickers` section, and at the top are drafts that work well for stickers.

As a general rule, stickers should be about **2 inches in their shortest axis**.
