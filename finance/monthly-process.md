# Monthly accounting and budget projection process

Each month, we get a new batch of [monthly reports and accounting data](#accounting:statements) from CS&S.
We use this as an opportunity to:

- Confirm that our Contracts information is correct.
- Confirm that our accounting transactions look correct.
- Flag any items that require extra attention, such as Contracts that will expire soon.
- Update our financial projections and calculate a new runway for 2i2c.

Here's information about expectations and accountability for the process:

- **When**: This process is triggered by the arrival of [new accounting reports](#accounting:statements) from CS&S.
- **Who**:
  - **The [](#role:delivery-manager)** is responsible for the overall process, and for monitoring the accounting and contracts statements each month.
  - The **[](#role:bd-lead)** is expected to coordinate with [](#role:delivery-manager), and is responsible for taking action to follow up with communities and/or trigger the proper processes in CS&S to move things forward. 

- **What**: [Here's a document with the process that we follow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iG2USbvccMGeobKpH52j37LZpmeNASKedJrb0mX8R8Y/edit?usp=sharing).
