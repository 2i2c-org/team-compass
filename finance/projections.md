# Budget projections

Our budget projection model begins with a source of truth about our **current and historical costs and revenue**, and then projects into the future by making assumptions about these numbers.

```{admonition} Feel free to edit and experiment
The projections sheet is a **tool** to be used to understand how our hiring and cost decisions will affect our finances moving forward.
Feel free to experiment with adding new line items to help guide decision-making about our costs.
```

It is stored as a Google Sheet at the following link:

See [this video overview of the budget model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1acDkO3jWifNtDl2LDkD37lKHtnjRf_jC/view?usp=drive_link) for an idea of how it is structured and how to use it.

## Update our budget projections model

Each month, we get a new batch of accounting data from CS&S.
We use this as an opportunity to update our budget projections, which includes the following actions:

- Confirm that our Contracts information is correct.
- Flag any items that require extra attention, such as Contracts that will expire soon.
- Update our financial projections and calculate a new runway for 2i2c.

[Here's a document with the process to update the budget projections](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iG2USbvccMGeobKpH52j37LZpmeNASKedJrb0mX8R8Y/edit?usp=sharing).

## Roles and responsibility for tracking our contracts portfolio

Our monthly process for tracking our contracts portfolio requires input from CS&S, the [](#role:delivery-manager) and the [](#role:bd-lead).
Both need to cultivate an ongoing understanding of the portfolio to:

- Be able to update it as a source of truth
- Identify accounting or contractual deviations.

### Delivery Manager's responsibilities

The Delivery Manager is responsible for monitoring the systems that we have for tracking contracts in collaboration with the CS&S team. 
Accounting deviations or concerns will be reported to the Partnership Lead.

The Delivery Manager is responsible for refining this process over time.

### Business Development Lead's responsibilities

The Business Development Lead is responsible for taking actions to follow up with communities and/or triggering processes in CS&S to move actions forward. They work closely with the Delivery Manager to ensure the system is working effectively.
