# Budget projections

Our budget projection model begins with a source of truth about our **current and historical costs and revenue**, and then projects into the future by making assumptions about these numbers.

```{admonition} Feel free to edit and experiment
The projections sheet is a **tool** to be used to understand how our hiring and cost decisions will affect our finances moving forward.
Feel free to experiment with adding new line items to help guide decision-making about our costs.

We should update our model each month as new data comes in.

## Roles and responsibility for tracking our contracts portfolio

Our monthly process for tracking our contracts portfolio requires input from CS&S, the [](#role:delivery-manager) and the [](#role:business-development-lead).
Both need to cultivate an ongoing understanding of the portfolio to:

- Be able to update it as a source of truth
- Identify accounting or contractual deviations.

### Delivery Manager's responsibilities

The Delivery Manager is responsible for monitoring the systems that we have for tracking contracts in collaboration with the CS&S team. 
Accounting deviations or concerns will be reported to the Partnership Lead.

The Delivery Manager is responsible for refining this process over time.

### Business Development Lead's responsibilities

The Business Development Lead is responsible for taking actions to follow up with communities and/or triggering processes in CS&S to move actions forward. They work closely with the Delivery Manager to ensure the system is working effectively.
