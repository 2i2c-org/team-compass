# Fundraising and philanthropy pipeline

We have a lightweight CRM and pipeline for raising funds through philanthropic gifts.
The document below describes the way this worked as of August 2024. It has since been integrated with a broader Sales CRM that was inspired by this one.
We need to update the information in the Google Doc accordingly, but leave it here for now because there is still a lot of useful information in it.
