## Ramp Cards Policy (for individual use)

This policy is intended to guide the allocation and use of CS&S Ramp cards. It should be considered an extension of the Team Compass policy on [Spending money](spending-money).

## Who is allowed to have Ramp cards

This policy is a guideline for team members (both employees and contractors) who want to be issued CS&S Ramp Credit Cards.

## When to use Ramp cards

The Ramp Cards should be treated as an additional mechanism for spending money on behalf of 2i2c.

Examples of good ways to use Ramp cards:

-   [Reimbursable expenses for our 2i2c team members](https://compass.2i2c.org/people/compensation/#list-of-additional-reimbursable-expenses-for-our-2i2c-team-members), including hardware, internet and wellness
-   [Personal and professional development](), including coaching, books, classes, conferences
-   Travel, team celebration, and meeting expenses, including marketing/swag

Examples of ways _not to use_ your individual Ramp cards:

-   Cloud costs or other expenses incurred by communities - we have a separate card for that (look for the details in Bitwarden if you need it)
-   [Services purchased on behalf of a team by area leads](spending-money) - use the team card, also in Bitwarden for persistent services)
-   Any contracted services - those should be paid directly by CS&S using invoices

## Additional consideration when using Ramp cards

The allowed list above is not exhaustive (by design). 2i2c treats people like adults and as such, we expect team members to use their best judgment in determining when and how to use the cards.

Questions team members should consider when using their cards in “_Good Faith_”:

-   Is this what's in the best interest of 2i2c?
-   Could this purchase or transaction be considered fraudulent (or unscrupulous)?

CS&S and 2i2c regularly review all transactions. Transactions that are deemed “Bad Faith” (opposite to _Good Faith_) will result in:

-   An internal review by the leadership team
-   Disciplinary actions (including possible termination).

These guidelines are (in parts) influenced by Netflix’s [expense policy](https://blog.pleo.io/en/netflix-doesnt-have-an-expense-policy-does-your-company-really-need-one).

## Uploading Ramp Receipts

**You must upload a receipt for all purchases, via ramp.com. **It is the responsibility of each 2i2c team member to upload receipts regarding transactions made with their personally assigned Ramp card.

CS&S has requested that all Ramp information/transactions must be updated in Ramp by the end of day EVERY Friday. Failure to do so may result in the loss of access to a Ramp card.
