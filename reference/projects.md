## Organization-building

As 2i2c is quite young, a major first step will be to build out our organizational infrastruture, team processes, and culture.

### Strategic Goal

Building a good organizational and team structure is an important first step in being successful for the next 3 / 6 / 12 / 24 months.

### Key outcomes

- Team members understand the goals and mission of the organization, and are aligned with them
- Team members understand how their role and workstreams fit into those goals
- We have healthy practices in communication and information-sharing
- We follow best-practices at remote teamwork and inclusivity
- We have a process to improve our team practices moving forward

### Project information

## Pan-foo hubs pilots

We are deploying several customized JupyterHubs for research communities that are related to the Pangeo project. These will generally be a bit more hands-on than the "self-serve" JupyterHub infrastructure.

### Strategic Goal

Our primary goal for these pilots is to learn how we can adapt the Pangeo infrastructure model to new use-cases, and to find patterns and technology that we can make easier to replicate and maintain. We also wish to have some research use-cases under our belt to better-understand their needs, and to make inroads into some research communities.

### Key outcomes

- Technology and documentation for deploying a Pangeo-style hub infrastructure with minimal toil and maintenance
- Documentation about the "pan-foo" model and the tools that it uses
- Feedback from our hub users about their experience, both good and bad.
- An understanding of financial perspective from hub users and their institutions that can fit into a sustainability model.
- Institutional buy-in and conversions to paying customers.

### Project Information

There are currently two organizations for which we are deploying these hubs, and these are being managed in two different places.

#### Farallon Institute

The [Farallon Institute](http://www.faralloninstitute.org/) is a research institute associated with NASA, they are running a Pangeo-like hub for their community.

  - [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/pangeo-data/FI-hub)

#### Catalyst Cooperative

The [Catalyst Cooperative](https://catalyst.coop/) is a cooperative consultancy and advocacy group for climate change policy. They curate several large datasets and wish to provide easy interactive computing access to these datasets.

Currently, we are working with this team via the Pilot Hubs, though we expect to move them to a dedicated hub if they wish to pursue the collaboration further.

(projects:jmte-pangeo)=
## Dev/ops for Jupyter Meets the Earth and Pangeo

The Pangeo project has considerable needs in both operating and developing hub infrastructure for their community. We are collaborating with them to provide both daily operations of their hubs, as well as help them in evolvin and improving their infrastructure to better-suit their scientific mission.

### Strategic Goal

Pangeo is a key partner of 2i2c and has collaborated with 2i2c founders for many years - it is a standard-bearer for science in the cloud, and an opportunity for 2i2c to both learn from and support their use-cases. We hope to use this partnership to both move Pangeo closer to sustainability, as well as to highlight how 2i2c infrastructure can be used for large-scale scientific analysis and communities. It is also an opportunity to support a scientific use-case that is within the mission of 2i2c's research goals.

### Key Outcomes

The key outcomes for this project are largely defined by the Pangeo community, as this will be an ongoing engagement. That said, we have a few core goals for 2i2c:

- Meet the deliverables from the NSF JMTE grant
- Improve JupyterHub technology for research through this collaboration
- Minimize toil and maintenance costs for deploying Pangeo-like hubs
- Learn more about the Pangeo deployments and document them so we can replicate them easily
- Make the Pangeo community happy with their collaboration with 2i2c. Convert this into an ongoing relationship of development support.
