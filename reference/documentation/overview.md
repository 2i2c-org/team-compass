# Documentation guide

2i2c uses the same documentation setup across all of our repositories.
This uses [the Sphinx documentation engine in Python](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) along with [a custom Sphinx theme called the `2i2c-sphinx-theme`](https://github.com/2i2c-org/sphinx-2i2c-theme) that we use to standardize the look and feel and some menu items across all of our documentation sites.

See the sections below for more information about the structure and instructions for editing our documentation.
