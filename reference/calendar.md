(calendars:external-meetings)=
## Scheduling meetings with external communities with `Cal.com`

Sometimes different subsets of 2i2c team members need to meet with specific external communities. Examples of these would be:

1. Specific sales calls that require technical input
2. Meetings during onboarding of a new community to our service
3. ???

We use [cal.com](https://cal.com/) to schedule these. There is a '2i2c team' that you will be added to the first time you
need to use this service (since there's a 15$ per month per member fee). Current owners are Jim Colliander, Yuvi and April -
one of them should be able to invite you.

We are currently creating a unique [Collective Meeting](https://cal.com/features/collective-events) for each meeting,
so we can customize which set of users need to be in it. As we gain more experience with these, we will improve how we use
these.

```{note}
Why cal.com instead of the more popular [calendly](https://calendly.com/)? Because cal.com is [open source software](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com)
available on a fairly normal license! While it probably is not exactly community maintained, it is closer enough aligned with our values that it is preferred, given that there seems to be no UX penalty.
