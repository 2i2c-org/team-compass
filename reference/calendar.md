(calendars:external-meetings)=
## Schedule meetings with external communities using `Cal.com`

We use [cal.com](https://cal.com/) to schedule meetings with others external to 2i2c.

Current owners are Jim C, Yuvi P, and April J -
one of them should be able to invite you.

### Get started with `cal.com`

- Create a `cal.com` account
- Ask a current owner to add you to the `2i2c team`.

### When to use `cal.com`

Any time you need to meet with one or more people external to 2i2c. Examples of these would be:

1. Sales calls that require technical input
2. Onboarding of a new community to our service
3. Community enablement service delivery that needs multiple 2i2c contributors

### How to create an event

Create a cal.com [Collective Meeting](https://cal.com/features/collective-events) for each meeting, and add the users that need to be in it. 

```{note}
Why cal.com instead of the more popular [calendly](https://calendly.com/)? Because cal.com is [open source software](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com)
available on a fairly normal license! While it probably is not community maintained, it is more closely aligned with our values and has a very similar UX.
