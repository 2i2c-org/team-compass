We use FreshDesk to manage our support queue.

## Average Handling Time

FreshDesk tracks 'Average Handling Time (AHT) ' for people whose role is 'Agent'. So we need to set up our team members as 'Agents' as well as 'Account Administrators' to enable this feature.

The AHT counter is only active while the ticket status is 'Open' (not Pending, Resolved, or Closed) and for the 'Assigned Agent'. The counter appears to increment only when the tab/window in the browser for that ticket is active and in-focus.
So it really is tracking the 'Handling Time' of the ticket by the assigned agent, and not the activity we are doing outside of FreshDesk related to solving the ticket.

FreshDesk also supports a 'Time Logs' feature of can be used for recording the time spent on a ticket but we are not using that feature within 2i2c.
