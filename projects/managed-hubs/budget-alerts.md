# Budget alerts response

We now have setup budget alerts for all cloud projects where we pay the bill from the cloud provider, independently if we pass through these costs or not to the community. However, we currently donâ€™t look to setup budget alerts for communities paying their cloud provider bill directly.

These alerts are being sent to the 2i2c freshdesk account.

## What to do when such an alert is triggered

If the alert is about a higher than expected budget spend, then you should communicate that to the community representative.

There is a template message to help you get started at [](support:templates:budget-alerts).

### Steps

1. Create a new email from freshdesk at https://2i2c.freshdesk.com/a/tickets/compose-email
2. Get the community contact's information from https://airtable.com/appbjBTRIbgRiElkr/pagD3XyZjqBunYMnC
3. Copy the message template from [](support:templates:budget-alerts) and paste it into the email's body editing it where appropriate
4. Mark the original budget alert ticket as resolved.
