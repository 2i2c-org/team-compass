Community Enablement is a collaborative support service that empowers community leaders and organizations to 
succeed with open, interactive computing infrastructure. 
We offer guidance, strategic partnership, and capacity-building beyond 
standard [Technical Support](../managed-hubs/support/index.md).

This documentation outlines the service's scope, procedures, implementation guidance, and reporting practices.
