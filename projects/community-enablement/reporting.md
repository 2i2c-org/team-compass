# Reporting


```{attention}
See https://github.com/2i2c-org/partnerships-reporting.
```
Each activity must be logged in Airtable with:
- Allocation
- Team Member
- Units of time
- Description
- Date(s)

Monthly reports:
- Per engagement PDF summary
- Aggregated team capacity dashboard
- MyST dashboards (internal)

1. The system of reporting consulting hours should be applicable across the entire 2i2c team.
    1. A global, shared, table to track consulting commitments (may be integrated with Engagements table)
    1. A global, shared, table will track the total number of consulting hours delivered. Key fields to track:
    1. Engagement (service agreement) this consulting activity is allocated to.
    1. Time period (two-week iteration) during which the consulting activity was delivered
    1. Name of the person delivering the consulting
    1. Number of consulting hours delivered (in units of 1 billable hour)
    1. Description of the consulting activity. Details of the activity should be proportional to the number of consulting hours delivered. If it was 1 hour of consulting, it might be “attended the weekly community meeting”. If it was 24 hours of consulting activity, a two page report may be more appropriate.
    1. Airtable interfaces to allow data entry of consulting activities
    1. Delivery Enablement can work with team members to create other automations to capture this information.
    1. Delivery Enablement can then use this shared data source to produce reports back to Business Development on the Consulting service performed on a per engagement basis.
2. Follow-up with communities
    1. 2i2c report back to communities the Consulting activity performed to date at regular intervals (monthly? Quarterly? Mid-point of engagement? At renewal time?)
    1. Business development should be notified when the number of Consulting hours not expected to be met in the period of performance. 
    1. Business development should be notified when the number of Consulting hours is approaching the number committed in the service agreement to trigger a conversation with the community (especially if a consulting overage rate is not already included in the engagement agreement)
    1. Deliver Enablement is responsible to communicate to Business Development the hours and status of each Consulting service 
    1. Business Development is responsible for communicating back to Communities and stakeholders what has been accomplished during 
    1. A standardized survey (Community Satisfaction) to be sent out when consulting is reported to communities. This information can be collected as part of a KPI on Consulting-as-a-Service.
