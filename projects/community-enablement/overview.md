# Overview of Community Enablement Service

The Community Enablement Service supports communities that benefit from collaborative partnership with 2i2c. It allows us to allocate dedicated staff to work closely with a community to reach specific goals. These engagements are time-bound and effort-bound.

## Goals
- Foster strong partnerships between 2i2c and community leaders.
- Enable communities to build capacity using open tools.
- Provide dedicated consulting, meeting participation, documentation support, and more.

## When to Offer
When Business Development identifies that a community needs support beyond infrastructure or tiered support offerings, Community Enablement may be offered.
