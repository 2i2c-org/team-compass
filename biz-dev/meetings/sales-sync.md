# Sales Sync (_BizDev: Sales Sync_)

The primary mechanism to create alignment between Business Developement (BD) team, the Executive Director and members of the P&S team is via the weekly Business Developement Sales Sync.

**Team Calendar Link**: [BizDev: Sales Sync](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=M2g5OW4wcjNxYW83NTY4NHY3NDMwdTRtNHJfMjAyNTAyMDVUMTkwMDAwWiBoY2FtcGJlbGxAMmkyYy5vcmc&tmsrc=hcampbell%402i2c.org&scp=ALL)

The current structure of this meeting is defined below.

### WHY

This meeting is a ceremony to track the progress of opportunities in our sales pipeline. It is intended to involve those on in the "sales / biz dev / fundraising" side of our operations.

**Key question**: Are the number and amount of opportunities on track to meet our sustainability KPIs?

The status of any individual lead should already be available in the CRM interface (see our 2i2c Airtable) so we do not expect to review each and every opportunity in the pipeline. However, this meeting can be used to address opportunities that are stale or stuck or in need of reprioritization.

### CADENCE

Weekly meeting to review the "Sales Opportunities Pipeline" (as being prototyped in https://github.com/2i2c-org/meta/issues/1455)

### ATTENDEES (and the rational for their attendance)

-   **Senior Account Executive** [Jim Colliand], meeting owner (required)
-   **Senior Product Manager, Open Science Enablement** [James Munroe] (required until the sales system is robust) he is helping to design, implement and prototype systems for the sales workflow and the sales <> P&S information exchange
-   **Delivery Manager/Chief of Staff** [Harold Campbell] (optional) - He is helping to set up the CRM and this makes him a natural attendee while we build muscle around using this system
-   **Executive Director** [Chris Holdgraf] (typically optional unless there is a hot lead to shape) - occasionally needs to attend because he is sometimes serving as an “Account Executive” on some of 2i2c’s opportunities
