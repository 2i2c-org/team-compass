# Project Management alignment (_P&S: Project Management_)

The P&S Project Management meeting is a cross-team alignment ceremony between Delivery Enablement, BD and P&S that is focused on reviewing project progress and reducing delivery risk.

**Team Calendar Link**: [P&S: Project Management](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=OGtvb2JsODlvN2I3MzhpMmVhdWpkY2NscDlfMjAyNTAyMTBUMTcwMDAwWiBoY2FtcGJlbGxAMmkyYy5vcmc&tmsrc=hcampbell%402i2c.org&scp=ALL)

### WHY

We need to know the progress of projects that have been sold via contracts (and grants) so that we can prioritize and sequence work in the P&S team's backlog.

Consequently, the outcomes of the meeting are defined below.

1. Review the list of Engagements and Projects, identifying Projects that are:

    A. **Ready for P&S Delivery** – These projects will need an issue created and added to the P&S team’s backlog for delivery

    B. **Not sufficiently scoped** – These will need an owner from the P&S team that will be accountable for defining the necessary Project Deliverables.

1. Share progress on Engagements or Projects:

    A. Share status update of Engagements/Projects where necessary

    B. Review the risks and project progress

    C. Projects that are nearing completion (so P&S can make sure BD has results / impact to highlight for renewal)

1. Verify that the Engagements and Projects are on track

    A. **Delayed** – As a team we’ll need to understand how to move those projects forward and identify a steward to move the project forward. Delayed projects are projects that haven’t been started and we are beyond the contract start date.

### How we work?

1. **Prework** - Ensure that the **Engagements** [AirTable Link](https://airtable.com/appbjBTRIbgRiElkr/pagpZcdEaghJQiYH3) all have Opportunities
2. Use the Delivery Enablement Engagements interface in [Airtable](https://airtable.com/appbjBTRIbgRiElkr/pagpZcdEaghJQiYH3), sorted by Start Date
3. Quickly scan each project, and deep dive in the ones that need attention (Red or Amber RAG status)
    1. **Action needed**: Add RAG status to the CRM
    2. If the **Project** [AirTable Link](https://airtable.com/appbjBTRIbgRiElkr/pag0zFFd2NaJHBHN5) is new, is it clearly scoped and ready for delivery?
        1. Yes - Add appropriate deliverable(s) as initiative(s) or tasks on the P&S board
        2. No - Agree on actions to make it ready for delivery, which could include initiatives
    3. If the project is in flight and has at least 6 months left, is it healthy?
        1. Yes - move on, good job!
        2. No - decide on corrective action
    4. If the project is near the end (less than 6 months left), does it need a report, showcase and/or renewal pitch?
        1. Yes - capture that as a deliverable & P&S initiative
        2. No - flag for future decommissioning (which means P&S needs to decommission a hub, so add appropriate tasks)
4. Capture action items for engagements that need refinements, updates or intervention with the community or buyer
    1. Change status to **“Needs review”**
    2. Capture specific action (the **Delivery Manager** is going to make sure this pops up in the CRM correctly, so we have a table of actions we need to take across all projects, then update this list)
5. Probably not part of this meeting, but useful for Business Development to manage renewals:
    1. Review any **Lapsed Active engagements** (we’re still doing work post contract period, pending renewals - these require BD action)
    2. Review any **Active & Needs Renewed** (reaching the end of an engagement to look at things that need renewals, which the automation in Airtable will flag for any engagement with an end date &lt; 6 months)
