# Sales Operations

Our Business Development sales operations is broken down across five distinct stages. These are described below.

## Leads

**Leads** is the activity that used to educate the market about our products and services. It also serves the ancillary purpose of connecting communities and sharing knowledge back into the science and open source ecosystem.

Marketing is a sub-process of the Leads stage that involves content creation and curation. The key artifacts generated at this stage include:

-   Shareable assets
-   Social media posts

## Sales

**Sales** consists of two sub-processes, namely Pre-sales and Sales.

Pre-sales focuses on the identification of possible customers/communities for our Business Development team to engage.

Sales focuses on moving the customers/communities through our CRM pipleline. The CRM pipeline is a workflow that consists of the following stages:

1. **Qualifying** - Establish if a community presents a possible "sales opportunity"
1. **Prospecting** - Identifying if 'sales opportunity" can benefit from our products and services and if so, could they become a future customer. Doing this early allows us to increase the likelihood that we can convert them into a future customer.
1. **Partnering** - Agreeing on the statement of work that needs to be delivered by 2i2c to the future-customer/community for them to relaize value from our products and services.
1. **Invoicing** - Presenting the future-customer with a contract or Memorandum of understanding (MoU), an invoice and then getting paid. This formally moves the future-customer to a 2i2c customer relationship.

The key artifacts generated at this stage include:

-   Proposals
-   Quotes
-   Signed Agreement
-   Partner onboarding
-   Asana (2i2c <> CS&S)
-   HelloSign (CS&S)
-   Invoice (CS&S)
-   Airtable (CS&S)

### Delivery

Delivery is a multi-step stage that includes close collaboration with the P&S team and Delivery Enablement team. Delivery is used to "roll-out" the products and services for our customers.

The steps include the following:

1. **Provisioning** - Here we perform activities to ensure effective project management our contractural obligations (see engagement management). The Key artifacts here are AirTable records and a Statement of Work (SoW).

1. **Ongoing services** delivery - At this step, we generate tasks that are provisions via the P&S Team's delivery process. Additionally, we provide infrasture monitoring and support at this step. Key artifacts are P&S Backlog items, delivery commitments.

1. **Milestone reporting** - The final sub-step for delivery is Impact reporting. This helps 2i2c, our customers (and their communities) know if we met delivered the goals of the contracts (or grants).

### Renewals

Finally, Renewals focuses on renewing or extending our collaboration and partnership with our existing customers/communities. The Key artifacts here are:

-   Usage reports
-   Agreement renewals
-   Decommission requests.
