# Creating alignment

We use several meetings to create alignment and coordinate business development across our teams.
These meetings are currently:

-   Sales Sync (_[BizDev: Sales Sync](meetings/sales-sync.md)_)
-   Product Sync (_[BizDev - Product Sync](meetings/product-sync.md)_)
-   Project Management alignment (_[P&S: Project Management](meetings/project-management-alignment.md)_)
-   Horizon Scanning (_[P&S: Horizon Scanning](meetings/horizon-scanning.md)_)
