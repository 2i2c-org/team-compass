# Creating alignment
The primary mechanism to create alignment between Biz Dev, the Executive Director and members of the P&S team is via the weekly BizDev Sales Sync.
The current structure of this meeting is defined below.

## WHY
This meeting is a ceremony to track the sales pipeline. It is intended to involve those on in the "sales / biz dev / fundraising" side of our operations. 

**Key question**: Are the number and amount of opportunities on track to meet our sustainability KPIs?  

The status of any individual lead should already be available in the CRM interface (see our 2i2c Airtable) so we do not expect to review each and every opportunity in the pipeline. However, this meeting can be used to address opportunities that are stale or stuck or in need of reprioritization.

## CADENCE
Weekly meeting to review the "Sales Opportunities Pipeline" (as being prototyped in https://github.com/2i2c-org/meta/issues/1455)

## ATTENDEES (and rational for their attendance)
- Senior Account Executive [Jim Colliand], meeting owner (required)
- Senior Product Manager, Open Science Enablement [James Munroe] (required until the sales system is robust) - he is helping to design, implement and prototype systems for the sales workflow and the sales <> P&S information exchange
- Delivery Manager [Harold Campbell] (required until 2025-01-15, optional thereafter) - He is helping to set up the CRM and this makes him a natural attendee while we build muscle around using this system
- Executive Director [Chris Holdgraf] (typically optional unless there is a hot lead to shape) - occasionally needs to attend because he is sometimes serving as the “Account Executive” on some of 2i2c’s opportunities
