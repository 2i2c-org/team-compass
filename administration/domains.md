# Web domains and DNS

We use [NameCheap](https://namecheap.com) to manage 2i2c's web domains (e.g. `2i2c.org`) as well as the DNS / routing for them.

`2i2c.org` is owned by **Jim Colliander**, with access given to several team members to modify DNS etc.
If you want access to do so, ask Jim to add you.

We have a `2i2c Admin` NameCheap account but it's not used to manage any domains yet.
It's there for a future attempt at centralizing control under one account.
Credentials to access it are in our [BitWarden account](account:bitwarden).

**Other domains may be registered elsewhere** for historical reasons.
For example, they might be in an individual's NameCheap account, or on another service.
If you don't see a domain in NameCheap ask around and somebody can help you.
