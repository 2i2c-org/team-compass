# Web domains and DNS

We use [NameCheap](https://namecheap.com) to manage 2i2c's web domains (e.g. `2i2c.org`) as well as the DNS / routing for them.
Credentials to access it are in our [BitWarden account](account:bitwarden).

**Some domains may be registered elsewhere** for historical reasons.
For example, they might be in an individual's NameCheap account, or on another service.
If you don't see a domain in NameCheap ask around and somebody can help you.
