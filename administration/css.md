# CS&S Administration

There are a few ways in which we interact with {term}`Code for Science and Society`.
This page provides an overview.

## How do I contact CS&S?

CS&S has a generic e-mail address that they use for triaging any questions from their FSPs.
You can find it below.
Feel free to use for any questions:

E-mail address: **`fsp@codeforscience.org`**.

## Where can I find the CS&S Employee Handbook?

Find the [CS&S employee handbook here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bBBwWq_Q9-yQyzFFGtiDoHWCiqtOvxf1/view?usp=drive_link).

It describes all of the policies for their employees (which includes all of 2i2c's staff).

```{role} CS&S Operations
```
## CS&S Operations

To discuss invoices, contracting, etc.
This includes most "administrative actions" that we need help with, such as work with *external parties* regarding onboarding, signatures, invoicing, etc.

To communicate, we should use the genercal CS&S intake e-mail.

E-mail address: **`fsp@codeforscience.org`**.

```{role} CS&S FSP
```

## Google Group

We have a dedicated Google Group and e-mail that we use to provide CS&S team members access to our files.

- **`css-admin@2i2c.org`**

This is because they need visibility into many of our operational information for bookkeeping and accountability purposes.
It contains several administrative and organizational leaders of CS&S.
They are all listed as managers, so can add people on their own.

In Google Drive, you may add the `css-admin@2i2c.org` group to the sharing list for a folder or file and they will have access.


```{note}
The list above is fairly comprehensive â€“ there is no need to use any other aliases (such as `accounting@codeforscience`, etc.) since they are intended for outgoing use.
```
