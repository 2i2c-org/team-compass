# How we communicate with one another

## Formal and project communication

2i2c uses GitHub issues and pull-requests to track more *formal* communication on projects and discussions. These issues are generally used as the {term}`Single Source of Truth` for most of our projects. When in doubt, create an issue so that we can track its progress. Check the repositories in [the `2i2c-org` GitHub org](https://github.com/2i2c-org) for where these conversations happen.

In general, you are expected to monitor repositories that are important to the work that you're doing. Keep up-to-date with new issues and comments on pre-existing issues. These are the official record of "things happening" in 2i2c.

## Informal communication

Informal communication happens in the 2i2c Slack channel ([http://2i2c.slack.com/](http://2i2c.slack.com/)). This Slack has both 2i2c staff and founding team members, as well as several other interested parties. You should now have access to the 2i2c Slack. If not, send one of the team members an email.

All information with 2i2c must have a {term}`Single Source of Truth`. Since information is fairly difficult to archive and discover on Slack, we *do not* treat it as a source of truth. Use it for coordination and communication, but make sure that any important information is documented elsewhere.

Here are things that **should not** be in Slack, but instead put in an issue or other Source of Truth location:

- Important updates on the status of a project or issue
- Decisions that were made from conversations in Slack
- Important dates or deadlines announced on Slack
- Major bugs or problems that were unconvered on Slack
- New ideas that warrant follow-up

You are *encouraged* but not *required* to take part in conversation on Slack.
