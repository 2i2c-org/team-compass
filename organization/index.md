# Organization

Organization-wide strategy, policy, and structure.

## Core strategy

Our strategy documents form a progression from **why we exist** to **how we execute**:

1. **[Mission](mission.md)** - Why 2i2c exists and what we believe. (timeline: 3+ years)
2. **[Theory of Impact](theory-of-impact.md)** - Our long-term theory of change, the big-picture problem we hope to solve, and how we position ourselves to solve it. (timeline: 3+ years)
3. **[Strategy](strategy.md)** - The next checkpoint we are building towards, the biggest challenge to overcome next to get there, and our guiding principles to solve that challenge. (timeline: 2-3 years)
4. **[Value Proposition](value-proposition.md)** - The key stakeholders we deliver value to, and our narrative for what our value is for each. (timeline: 1-2 years)
5. **[Business Plan](plan.md)** - An assessment of our financial reality, and the quarterly priorities we must achieve in order to follow our strategy in a sustainable way. (timeline: 1 year)
