# Key Performance Indicators

We use **Key Performance Indicators** to measure and track our progress and impact as an organization.[^1]
Each area of 2i2c defines its own KPIs, you can find a reference for each below.

## Our KPIs dashboard

We have an _informal dashboard_ to make it easier to track certain KPIs.
It is a convenience and not a source of truth, so may not always be up to date if our KPI metrics change.

Find the KPIs dashboard at [`2i2c.org/kpis`](http://2i2c.org/kpis/).
Here are links to the major sections of that site:

[^1]: See [the Fast Forward Playbook on Impact Measurement](https://www.ffwd.org/playbook/impact-measurement/) for an overview of frameworks and metrics to assess impact. Our approach is not quite as complex as this one, as we are intentionally starting simple.

## KPI goals and principles

Our KPIs have the following goals:

- Signal our _impact_ as an organization
- Signal our _efficiency_ as an organization
- Be _measurable_ either quantitatively or qualitatively
- Be useful for _internal stakeholders_ to guide our strategy and actions
- Be useful for _external stakeholders_ to help them assess our success

As a general rule, the strategic objectives that we set should have an explicit influence on our KPIs.

KPIs **do not** have the following goals:

- Assess individual performance

We currently follow these principles in defining our KPIs:

- **Be measurable at our current capacity**. We should not require extra team members or services in order to measure our KPIs.
- **Start with the basics**. We should not get too-complex in our KPIs because we are new to this and still learning how to use them. We should define three or four at most.
- **Should be automatable**. We should be able to automatically generate our KPIs given data we have about our communities. This is because we have limited capacity to measure and track right now.

## How are KPIs used

We use our KPIs in two ways:

- When defining our strategy and objectives, they should be tied to an expected impact on our KPIs.
- In quarterly reports to external stakeholders we should occasionally highlight our KPIs to provide updates about our progress.
