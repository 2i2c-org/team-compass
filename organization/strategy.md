# Goals and strategy

This page describes 2i2c's overall organizational plan and most important objectives.
Our Strategic Plan is a combination of active and aspirational priorities that help us get closer to achieving our organizational mission.

## Organizational goals

Our current goals and strategy are defined in [our Quarterly Planning Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aI-NhVOqx6G1n8pBMS6oDSBaZlSoR2Z-jhudJMBbhg8/edit?tab=t.booqt11zw100). These draw heavily from our [Navigation Fund Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xIUGlzq3GYT7xWy7j6bMxqVG6P2_7erhY3USDdu1V_U/edit?tab=t.0#bookmark=id.rjsjvfo6qpxi).

Below is a summary of the main goals we have defined:

- **Goal #1:  Delivery**.  Develop the operating structure and team skills to efficiently scale our product and service delivery. 
- **Goal #2: Product**. Develop a product system that continuously improves and delivers value and impact at scale. 
- **Goal #3:  Sustainability**. Build a business model that is competitive and gives us resources to sustain and scale our service. 

## Product goals

Our Product and Business goals are currently driven by our [Value Proposition](#mission:value-proposition). We aim to more fully develop the **Product Strategy** and **Business Strategy** that flow from these goals.
