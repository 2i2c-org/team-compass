# Goals and strategy

## The challenge

Communities in research and education face too much **accidental complexity** that distracts them from their mission. They struggle with technical barriers to deploying and managing the infrastructure they need, and face social barriers in navigating the complex open source ecosystems that power their work. They are often forced to choose between proprietary services that risk vendor lock-in and ignore the community's unique identity, or managing their own infrastructure at the cost of their actual research.

At the same time, **open source communities are builders, not service providers.** They provide crucial infrastructure for scientific research, but are often under-resourced and lack the capacity to run reliable services or offer direct support to users. This leaves research communities with the burden of managing complex infrastructure themselves, or turning to proprietary vendors who do not share their values.

**This disconnect creates a negative feedback loop:** Research communities are trapped in inefficient silos, unable to contribute back to the tools they use. Open source communities lack the resources and engagement they need to thrive. By bridging this gap with **sustainable, shared services**, we can resolve the accidental complexity of infrastructure management and bring these communities into close proximity. This turns a negative loop into a virtuous cycle of co-creation, where research and education directly guides and supports the open source ecosystem.

## Our goal

Build a shared platform and service for interactive computing that enables research, education, and open source communities to co-create impact. Operate a network of community-controlled hubs where each community retains their own agency and identity, and where technical and social infrastructure enables them to learn from and leverage one another for shared impact.

Here are a few key aspects of this service we use to define success:

- **Accessible:** Removing technical and social barriers so diverse communities can participate.
- **Reliable:** Providing sustinable and stable infrastructure needed to trust open infrastructure for key workflows.
- **Generative:** Transforming usage into resources and contributions that sustain and grow the open source ecosystem.

## Our theory for impact

**Reliably running a hub service is a commodity.** By treating it as a commodity layer you can take for granted, we minimize the "drag" on research and education and allow them to focus on their work. While it must provide a high degree of **reliability** and trust, the true value of this technical infrastructure is not in its existence alone. 

Here's our unique value: We believe that by combining a **shared platform that provides standardized infrastructure** with a **service team deeply embedded in the ecosystem**, we bring communities into close technical and social proximity to have leveraged impact and sustainability.

Our theory works in four stages:

1.  **A shared platform creates technical leverage:** By running community-specific hubs on a single standardized platform, we create **technical proximity**. This allows us to efficiently solve hard problems once and push improvements to everyone at the same time.
2.  **Service facilitates connection:** Because we manage relationships with both our communities and the open source ecosystem, we can act as a bridge. We help communities navigate this network of collaborators, cross-pollinating knowledge to solve shared problems.
3.  **Connection enables collaboration:** This social proximity allows us to coordinate efforts that generate and channel resources. We help communities pool their funding, expertise, and capacity to tackle challenges that no single community could solve alone.
4.  **Collaboration fuels the Ecosystem:** We channel these resources and contributions back into the open source tools we rely on. This turns the "negative feedback loop" of the challenge into a **virtuous cycle**: better tools lead to better research, which leads to more resources for the tools.

## Our priorities

1. **Standardize a "commodity" layer that enables communities to specialize.**
   - **Automate the baseline:** Solve "boring" problems once (the 80%) so communities can focus on their unique mission.
   - **Empower self-service:** Give communities tools to own their identity (the 20%) without our bottleneck.
   - **De-risk operations:** Make open infrastructure the safe, reliable choice for research and education.
2. **Facilitate co-creation within the network.**
   - **Convene peers:** Actively bring communities together to share knowledge and solutions.
   - **Bridge the gap to open source:** Connect researchers directly to the open source projects they use.
   - **Turn users into contributors:** Help communities move from passive consumers to active participants.
3. **Earn our reputation and influence in the ecosystem.**
   - **Upstream first:** Contribute improvements directly upstream to maximize impact for everyone.
   - **Support healthy communities:** Invest in governance, documentation, maintenance, and community health, and actively demonstrate the impact their tools have for research and education.
   - **Represent our network:** Explicitly represent research and education communities' needs to the open source projects they rely on.
4. **Build a sustainable and scalable model.**
   - **Build a baseline:** Use recurring memberships (e.g., from institutions) to ensure reliable, professional operations.
   - **Pool resources:** Leverage the network's collective power to fund ecosystem improvements no single community could afford.
   - **Accelerate delivery:** Rapidly deploy these improvements to everyone, proving the value of the network and tightening the feedback loop.

## Putting strategy into practice

Every decision should increase our leverage by leaning into the strategy above. Ask these questions before starting work:

- **Technical leverage:** Does this improve the efficiency of our platform, and the tools it offers to standardize our platform so we can move faster, or is it one-off work that only benefits one community?
- **Network leverage:** Does this connect communities to help them solve their own problems, or does it make us the bottleneck or reinforce silos?
- **Ecosystem leverage:** Does this build healthy influence with upstream projects, or does it either create unhealthy dependence on us or harm our relationship with them?
- **Sustainability leverage:** Does this generate resources that allow us to scale and sustain the service efficiently, or does it drain capacity or just barely help us get by?
