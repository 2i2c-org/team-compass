# Service model

This page describes how we engage with member communities and fund our work.
It's the primary way we implement [our strategy](./strategy.md).
For persona-driven messaging about outcomes for stakeholders, see [our value proposition](./value-proposition.md).

## Membership overview

Our primary engagement model is **membership** in a network.
This centers our mission-driven nature, and builds a feeling of mutual support and status between our member organizations.

Membership primarily drives cycles of a **development and operations flywheel**: membership **comes with standardized managed infrastructure**, and drives cycles of collaborative and **co-funded project work** that improve the infrastructure for everyone.

This creates a collaborative flywheel where our relatively  small team can efficiently manage infrastructure and facilitate collaboration between many different communities to support open source development.

- **Framing**: Membership is a way to pool resources on a shared service team (operations, development, and community engagement).
- **Cost recovery**: Membership covers core costs in operations, engagement, and upstream support.
- **Benefit**:
  - Participation in our core DevOps system.
  - Comes with managed infrastructure. This ensures we have a cycle between operations and development work.
  - Access to spaces and conversations communities otherwise would not have.
  - A way for communities to pool resources to contribute upstream.

## Membership

Our target business model includes membership with an optional "Premier membership" upgrade:

**Membership**
- **For**: Discrete communities with a homogeneous user base (e.g., a single research group or collaboration).
- **Impact**: The core loop that sustains 2i2c and covers the cost of making open infrastructure accessible and supported with foundational contributions.
- **Offers**:
  - Site Reliability Engineering for managed infrastructure.
  - Basic guidance in usage.
  - Participation in roadmapping exercises and co-funding opportunities.

**Premier membership option** (strategic for some communities)
- **For**: Strategic partners that want deeper engagement or investment in open source development. Usually serve more than one community that fits our membership profile.
- **Impact**: Drives deeper engagement and investment in open source, strategic guidance for 2i2c, and larger-scale growth within a community.
- **Offers**:
  - Strategic-level engagement from 2i2c, with more direction over our roadmap.
  - Coordination and guidance in planning and delivering technical improvements.
  - Tighter feedback loops and reporting between development and operations.

**Accessible service mechanism** (WIP, described as "Starter" membership; not currently prioritized)
- **For**: Communities that need standardized, commodity infrastructure with minimal customization.
- **Offers**: Commodified SRE evolving with open source. Automated operations with community-driven support.
- **Impact**: Makes open infrastructure largely accessible, even to communities that cannot cover the costs of foundational contributions and development.

## Co-funded projects with members

Project-based work gives members a way to influence our new development, and make it possible with funding. It is the engine that drives innovation and enhancement of our shared technical system.

- **For**: Any member organization that wants their infrastructure to be better (we do not distinguish between members with Premier membership and other members for co-funding).
- **Cost recovery**: Covers all R&D-style costs for new development.
- **Benefits**:
  - A mechanism to fund fractions of new development work to make it more likely to happen faster.
  - Engages communities to talk about shared problems, and to learn from one another.
  - A way to get credit for supporting open source infrastructure development.

## How membership and project work feed into one another

Each line of business benefits from network effects, and crucially depends on our development work and our operations work feeding into one another. As the number of member communities grows:

- They share more of the cost of operations, which decreases cost of service or increases support for open infrastructure.
- They increase the resources available for new development, which benefits the entire network.
- They have a larger group of communities to learn from, which increases learning and adoption of new workflows.
