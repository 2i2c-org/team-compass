# Mission and values

## Our mission

```{epigraph}
2i2c’s mission is to make research and education more **impactful**, **accessible**, and **delightful** by developing, operating, and supporting open infrastructure for interactive computing.
```

By pursuing this mission, we grow the world’s collective ability to make discoveries and learn from one another. By using open infrastructure, we ensure that these benefits are shared globally and cannot be captured by private interests.

## Our values

Our values are ideas that we believe are important for 2i2c to follow as it works towards its mission.
We strive to make decisions that align with our values, though recognize that they are sometimes in tension with one another and cannot be followed perfectly.

Our values are currently defined in [the Mission, values, and strategy page](https://2i2c.org/mission/) of our brochure site.
