## Our mission

```{epigraph}
2i2c's mission is to grow the world's collective ability to make discoveries and learn from one another by enabling communities to co-create through interactive computing and open infrastructure.
```

By focusing on networks of people and communities, we act as a force-multiplier that helps them be greater than the sum of their parts. By using open infrastructure, we ensure that these benefits are shared globally and cannot be captured by private interests.

Sustaining co-creation requires financial sustainability: open source needs capacity, communities need reliable services, and people need sustainable careers.

## Our values

Our values are ideas that we believe are important for 2i2c to follow as it works towards its mission.
We strive to make decisions that align with our values, though recognize that they are sometimes in tension with one another and cannot be followed perfectly.

Our values are currently defined in [the Mission, values, and strategy page](https://2i2c.org/mission/) of our brochure site.
