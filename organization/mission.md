# Mission and values

## Our mission

```{epigraph}
2i2c’s mission is to make research and education more **impactful**, **accessible**, and **delightful** by developing, operating, and supporting open infrastructure for interactive computing.
```

By pursuing this mission, we grow the world’s collective ability to make discoveries and learn from one another. By using open infrastructure, we ensure that these benefits are shared globally and cannot be captured by private interests.

## The problem we want to solve

Communities in research and education are a key engine of global knowledge creation, however, they have several key needs that are un-met:

- **Access to shared tools and resources**. Communities must choose between using proprietary services for data science (which are inaccessible to many and run the risk of lock-in), or managing their own infrastructure (which distracts from their core mission). This makes it harder for them to onboard, to create, and to collaborate.  
- **Guidance and skills for using these tools in their workflows.** Communities develop their own core workflows independently, and this leads to inefficient community learning, duplication of effort, and semi-arbitrary differentiation of workflows. This makes it harder to learn from and collaborate with one another.  
- **An efficient way to learn from other communities.** Communities lack the means and the time to collaborate and share knowledge across other communities in the data science ecosystem. This results in silos of experience and makes it hard for good ideas to be shared.  
- **An efficient way to improve open source technology.** Communities lack the experience and relationship with open source communities, and thus cannot effectively improve open technology in a reliable and scalable way. This causes them to build their own technology rather than contribute to collective efforts.

## Our values

Our values are ideas that we believe are important for 2i2c to follow as it works towards its mission.
We strive to make decisions that align with our values, though recognize that they are sometimes in tension with one another and cannot be followed perfectly.

Our values are currently defined in [the Mission, values, and strategy page](https://2i2c.org/mission/) of our brochure site.
