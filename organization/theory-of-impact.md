# Theory of Impact

Our theory for how we can best achieve our organizational mission in the long term.
Our [strategy](./strategy.md) describes more concrete guiding policies and actions we must take to follow this theory.

## The challenge

> Research and Education communities are trapped in a choice between managing fragile bespoke infrastructure or paying for proprietary silos. This fragmentation prevents them from leveraging their collective power and contributing back to the open source tools they rely on.

Communities in research and education struggle with technical barriers to deploying and managing the infrastructure they need, and social barriers in navigating the open source ecosystems that power their work.
They often have to choose between proprietary services that risk vendor lock-in and ignore the community's unique identity, or self-managed infrastructure that distracts from their actual research.

At the same time, **open source communities are builders, not service providers.** They provide crucial infrastructure for scientific research, but are under-resourced and lack the capacity to run reliable services or dedicated support. This leaves research communities with the burden of managing complex infrastructure themselves, or turning to proprietary vendors who do not share their values.

**This disconnect creates a negative feedback loop:** Research communities are trapped in inefficient silos, unable to contribute back to the tools they use. Open source communities lack the resources and engagement they need to thrive.

## Our theory of impact

> We support research communities with interactive computing hubs, and reinvest their resources into open source communities to strengthen the tools they depend on.

- **Remove the accidental complexity of shared infrastructure with open tools**: By offering a sustainable, shared infrastructure service, we can resolve the accidental complexity of infrastructure management so communities can focus on their work.
- **Facilitate effective cycles of development**: By creating a high-bandwidth connection between people **developing** open technology, people **operating** the technology, and people **using** the technology, we can improve the effectiveness and speed with which new development serves the research community.
- **Facilitate learning between communities**: By bringing communities together and standardizing on the same infrastructure, we can facilitate learning and collaboration between them.
- **Reliable and scalable support for open communities**. By being stewards and collaborators with open source projects (not "owners" of them), we can use the engine above to facilitate contributions from ourselves and our collaborators into open source.

This turns a negative loop into a virtuous cycle of co-creation, where research and education directly guide and support the open source ecosystem. **Our goal is to build this service in a way that is sustainable and scalable**.

## The virtuous cycle we aim to enable

This proximity enables a virtuous cycle of co-creation:

1. **A shared platform creates technical leverage:** By running independent community hubs on a single standardized platform and team, we can serve many communities more efficiently by enhancing technology and deploying it for all of them at once.
2. **Service facilitates connection:** Because we manage relationships with both our communities and the open source ecosystem, we can act as a bridge. We help communities navigate this network of collaborators, cross-pollinating knowledge to solve shared problems.
3. **Connection and shared tooling enable collaboration:** The combination of social proximity and a heavy overlap in tooling allows us to coordinate efforts that generate and channel resources. We help communities pool their funding, expertise, and capacity to tackle challenges that no single community could solve alone.
4. **Collaboration fuels the ecosystem:** We channel these resources and contributions back into the open source tools we rely on. This turns the "negative feedback loop" of the challenge into a virtuous cycle: better tools lead to better research, which leads to more resources for the tools.

2i2c's virtuous cycle of co-creation: we provide communities access to shared data, computing, and tools to co-create discoveries, which generates resources to support open source communities, which leads to technology enhancements that benefit everyone and that we can deploy to our community network. This continuous co-creation between science communities and open source communities sustains and grows the impact of open infrastructure.
