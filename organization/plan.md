# Business Plan 2026

Last updated: **December 2025**.

## Current business reality

We currently have two lines of business:

- **A membership service that doesn't yet cover its fixed costs.** Our membership service involves managing infrastructure for communities, and we do not yet have the volume of memberships needed to cover our costs.
- **A consultative service that is subsidizing the membership service.** We perform grant- and SOW-based work that subsidizes the cost of our membership service. This is risky if this work is not aligned with our membership service needs.

## Key challenge for 2026

We must **align our consultative work and our membership service** to ensure that we have capacity to deliver on both. Additionally, we must **lower the cost of delivering our membership service** to free up more time for development and deeper engagement with consultative work. ***We must integrate consultancy and SRE businesses so that they are greater than the sum of their parts.***

## 2026 strategic focus

Our [service model strategy](#service-model) describes three membership tiers: Membership, Premier, and Essential. In 2026, we focus on building a strong foundation with standard Membership while laying groundwork for future growth:

**Primary focus: General Membership tier**
- Build a member network that can be served with one roadmap
- Prove the co-funding model works at scale
- Establish efficient operations that can support future growth

**Not a focus in 2026:**
- _Essential membership:_ We do not see Essential hubs as a sales target for 2026. We will allow essential-style hubs when a member community does all the sales on our behalf (e.g., CloudBank classrooms). We must revisit the value proposition of essential tier when we have a stronger sustainable foundation.
- _Direct Premier sales:_ Premier member organizations require time to develop. We aim to "land and expand" by building trust at the General Membership level first. We anticipate gradual ramping up of Premier sales but are not prioritizing direct sales in 2026.

## Major actions to take

Our 2026 actions are organized by the three [strategic priorities](#strategic-priorities) defined in our strategy:

### Platform and infrastructure

- **Build a process for developing in uncertain directions.** Establish clear processes for handling development work where requirements are still emerging.

### Services and community relationships

- **Member growth.** Build a member network that can be served with one roadmap. Refine our model of member communities so that one roadmap can be useful to them all.
- **Update our membership value proposition.**
  - **Frame membership as collectively advancing open source.** Revisit our membership value propositions to make sure it is still competitive if we want *all* members to participate in this SOW process.
  - **Become excellent at giving credit to members that funded work.**
  - **Use project-based work to highlight the value of membership.** Put "participate in our roadmap" as a key value of membership. Use the new development as a key part of membership sales pitches.

### Business development

- **Turn our roadmap into a sales asset**. It must be accessible, with all the information needed for a community to decide to buy.
  - **Proactively use the roadmap.** Build proactive roadmap sales efforts into our sales activities.
  - **Don't sell a delivery time, sell a slot in a queue.** In our sales work, tell communities that we aren't selling a specific date. We are selling a commitment that something will be built and we are adding it to the queue.
- **Financial reporting.** Build sales data we can use to gauge our progress. Define a source of truth for our business and revenue projections so that we know if we're hitting the targets we describe below.
- **Capacity planning.** Freeze hiring for now. Conditionally freeze hiring for 2026. Depends on us hitting sales targets.

## 2026 Q1 priorities

- Priority 1: BD: Get the SOW / costed work secured.
  - Regular updates on this.
- Priority 2: P&S: Tighten our delivery and reporting practices around costed work.
- Priority 3: BD: start an engine around advanced tier memberships
  - Build out enough of the co-funding model and public roadmap to have a clear value proposition for advanced sales.
  - Need a way to showcase the value that 2i2c delivers via this co-funding.

## Expected revenue growth targets

**2026 forecast**

1. Current base
   - Maintain our current base ARR
   - Close expected NRR deals
   - Continue Navigation Fund through 2026
2. New growth
   - Grow NRR/project work to cover Navigation Fund gap in 2027
   - Advanced volume sales

**2027 forecast**

1. Deliver on the SOW work that we sell in 2026 in order to cover the Navigation Fund gap.
2. Shift sales focus to upselling general members into premier tier members for deeper engagements.
3. Assess whether our targets for balancing project-based work and memberships is realistic.

## Risks

- **Sales costs**
  - **Co-funding actually multiplies our sales cost and complexity.** It is basically engaging in N sales conversations to co-fund something, rather than a simpler 1:1 mapping. This will grow the complexity and confusion around sales costs.
- **Sales growth**
  - **We can't grow general memberships quickly enough to hit our targets.** The sales cycle is long and low-probability. We may not get it up and running.
  - **Communities don't see enough value in getting a "slot" rather than a guaranteed deliverable.** They need more guarantees of the outcomes or timelines and won't commit funding without a lot of work.
- **Delivery**
  - **Our delivery team does not have the capacity to deliver SOWs *and* serve growing member organizations.** We learn that we cannot both onboard new advanced tier communities AND complete the SOW-based work we're committing to in 2026 and 2027. We hit a lot of "that can't be done on time because our team is busy dealing with fires" signals.
  - **We force communities into an unrealistic amount of detail before an SOW can be funded.** We might over-index on the need for "specificity" and force ourselves into a state where we demand "waterfall-style" project planning before we can engage in an SOW.
  - **Contributions from us are rejected by upstream communities.** We might take costed work that an upstream community rejects, because we don't have the alignment with their roadmap or the trust with them.
- **Value proposition**
  - **WASM-based notebooks will eat our lunch.** Enough low-cost alternatives become available that communities don't see the value of more expensive cloud operations.
