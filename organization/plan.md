# Plan for 2026

This is our annual plan, and serves as an input to quarterly planning. It is updated more frequently as we learn throughout the year.

Last updated: **January 2025**.

## Current business reality

We currently have two lines of business:

- **A membership service that doesn't yet cover its fixed costs.** Our membership service involves managing infrastructure for communities, and we do not yet have the volume of memberships needed to cover our costs.
- **A consultative service that is subsidizing the membership service.** We perform grant- and SOW-based work that subsidizes the cost of our membership service. This is risky if this work is not aligned with our membership service needs.

We are in the middle of finalizing new financial systems that will sharpen these financial predictions, so put error bars of a few months on everything here.
:::

- **Revenue** `$172K/month` revenue.  
  - Small contracts (2%), Medium contracts (11%), Large contracts (48%), MAUs (8%), Fundraising and gifts (32%)  
- **Costs:** `$180K/month` burn  
  - Almost all personnel and FSP fees.  
- **2026 outlook:** Provided 2i2c maintains the current customer base, we are set up to operate at nearly break-even through 2026.  
- **Future outlook:**   
  - Our largest philanthropy gift (Navigation Fund) runs out Dec 31, 2026.  
  - Creates a `-$66K/month` gap in 2027.  
  - To extend into 2027 with the current cost structure, we must establish monthly cash-flow of `$66K/month` (`$700K annual`) in revenue in 2027.  

We have **enough runway with current contracts to last us the year, but a $700K annual gap starting in 2027**.

## Key challenge for 2026

We must:

- **Align and streamline our membership and our development work** to ensure that we have capacity to deliver on both, and to ensure they feed into one another.
- **Create a sales system that reliably generates new funded development opportunities** so that we can efficiently drive development opportunities via members.
- **Grow our member network to generate enough development work** so that we have enough sales volume to cover our cost gap in 2027.

## 2026 strategic focus

Our [service model strategy](#service-model) describes three membership tiers: General Membership, Premier Membership, and Essential Membership. In 2026, we focus on building a strong foundation with General Membership while laying groundwork for future growth:

**Primary focus: General Membership and a co-funding system**
- Build a member network that can be served with one roadmap
- Prove the co-funding model works at scale
- Establish efficient operations that can support future growth

## Major actions to take

Our 2026 actions are organized by the three [strategic priorities](#strategic-priorities) defined in our strategy (quarterly estimates are rough, and not set in stone):

### Platform and services

By end of Q1:

- **Wrap up infrastructure reliability work to focus on development.** Quickly finish our monitoring, reporting, and alerting efforts so that we can safely spend more time engaging in development with member communities.
- **Create an MVP system for engaging communities on our own times.** Define the general system of community engagement we aim for, and the most important thing to develop first. Use learning from this quarter to decide what to prioritize for Q2.
- **Make our development cycle more participatory and iterative**.
  - **Roadmap**: Our roadmapping and planning must invite regular participation from communities, and should be easy to follow-along as we build.
  - **Development**: Our design / development / feedback / reporting loop must be tighter, so that we can engage in more development work to sustain the organization.

End of Q2:

- **Speed up the time it takes to deploy improvements to our member network**. As new development happens, it must be deployed to our network more efficiently and quickly, so that they constantly feel the benefit of our development efforts.

### Business development

End of Q1:

- **Land our current in-progress sales.** This will ensure we have enough revenue to get through the year.
- **Turn our roadmap into a sales asset**. It must be accessible, with all the information needed for a community to decide to buy.
  - **Proactively use the roadmap.** Build proactive roadmap sales efforts into our sales activities.
  - **Don't sell a delivery time, sell a slot in a queue.** In our sales work, tell communities that we aren't selling a specific date. We are selling a commitment that something will be built and we are adding it to the queue.

End of Q2:

- **Grow General members enough to drive development.** Build a member network that can be served with one roadmap. Refine our model of member communities so that one roadmap can be useful to them all.

End of Q4+:

- **Sell enough development work to cover our cost gap**. Leverage our sales system and network of communities to get commitments for funding in 2027 that cover our development costs.

### Organization-wide

End of Q1:

- **Freeze hiring for now.** Conditionally freeze hiring for 2026 until:
  1. We have better financial and sales reporting.
  2. Financial models suggest it's safe to hire.
- **Update our membership value proposition.**
  - **Frame membership as collectively advancing open source.** Revisit our membership value propositions to make sure it is still competitive if we want *all* members to participate in this SOW process.
  - **Use project-based work to highlight the value of membership.** Put "participate in our roadmap" as a key value of membership. Use the new development as a key part of membership sales pitches.

End of Q1:

- **Build a sales data system we can use to gauge our progress**. Define a source of truth for our business and revenue projections so that we know if we're hitting the targets we describe below.

## Expected revenue growth targets

**2026 forecast**

1. Current base  
   * Maintain our current base ARR (target: $1.48M)  
   * Close expected NRR deals: $500K (JupyterHealth, IVEDA, NextGen, Usage Quotas)  
   * Final Navigation Fund amount:  $700K (NF) + $500K (expected NRR)  
   * Total: $2.7M (some buffer)  
2. New growth  
   * Grow NRR/project work to cover $500K in the next year (2027, replaces Navigation Fund)  
   * Advanced volume sales (target: 20, +$300K)

**2027 forecast**: $1.8M ARR + $500K (SOW) = $2.3M (tight; track 2026 buffer; manage cash flow)

3. 2i2c will maintain our 2026 base ARR (target: $1.8M) into 2027  
4. 2i2c will actively sell memberships (target: $500K ARR) in 2027  
5. 2i2c will complete delivery on SOWs sold in 2026 in 2027  
6. 2i2c will sell joint venture SOWs for development in 2028 (target: $500K+ NRR).

**2028 forecast**: $2.3M ARR + $500K SOW = $2.8M

## Risks

- **Sales costs**
  - **Co-funding actually multiplies our sales cost and complexity.** It is basically engaging in N sales conversations to co-fund something, rather than a simpler 1:1 mapping. This will grow the complexity and confusion around sales costs.
- **Sales growth**
  - **We can't grow general memberships quickly enough to hit our targets.** The sales cycle is long and low-probability. We may not get it up and running.
  - **Communities don't see enough value in getting a "slot" rather than a guaranteed deliverable.** They need more guarantees of the outcomes or timelines and won't commit funding without a lot of work.
- **Delivery**
  - **Our delivery team does not have the capacity to deliver SOWs *and* serve growing member organizations.** We learn that we cannot both onboard new advanced tier communities AND complete the SOW-based work we're committing to in 2026 and 2027. We hit a lot of "that can't be done on time because our team is busy dealing with fires" signals.
  - **We force communities into an unrealistic amount of detail before an SOW can be funded.** We might over-index on the need for "specificity" and force ourselves into a state where we demand "waterfall-style" project planning before we can engage in an SOW.
  - **Contributions from us are rejected by upstream communities.** We might take costed work that an upstream community rejects, because we don't have the alignment with their roadmap or the trust with them.
- **Value proposition**
  - **WASM-based notebooks will eat our lunch.** Enough low-cost alternatives become available that communities don't see the value of more expensive cloud operations.

## Not a focus in 2026

- _Essential Membership:_ We do not see Essential hubs as a sales target for 2026. We will allow essential-style hubs when a member community does all the sales on our behalf (e.g., CloudBank classrooms). We must revisit the value proposition of Essential Membership when we have a stronger sustainable foundation.
- _Direct Premier Membership sales:_ Premier member organizations require time to develop. We aim to "land and expand" by building trust at the General Membership level first. We anticipate gradual ramping up of Premier Membership sales but are not prioritizing direct sales in 2026.
