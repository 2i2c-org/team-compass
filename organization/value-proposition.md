# Value proposition

We create a high-bandwidth connection between people **developing** open technology, people **operating** the technology, and people **using** the technology. We only develop infrastructure that serves the network of communities for whom we manage infrastructure.

See [our service model](#service-model) for membership tier details.

## Value by persona

### For hub users (researchers, students, practitioners)

**Stop managing servers. Start doing your work.**

Get instant access to the same battle-tested interactive computing infrastructure used by top research communities globally. Focus on your science, not the server.

**What you get:**
- Instant, standardized access to JupyterHub and interactive computing tools
- Battle-tested infrastructure that just works
- Access to shared data, computing resources, and collaborative tools

### For hub administrators (technical leads, research computing staff)

**Customize and control without the operational burden.**

Leverage tools and workflows co-developed by the scientific community. Benefit instantly from open source enhancements while learning from a network of administrators like you.

**What you get:**
- Self-service customization using community-standard tools
- Automatic deployment of ecosystem improvements
- Peer learning network of administrators solving similar challenges
- Freedom to replicate and modify (Right to Replicate)

### For community leaders (PIs, directors, decision-makers)

**Pool resources. Amplify impact. Keep control.**

Join a network of peer organizations that collectively fund the open source tools you all rely on. Control your infrastructure with the Right to Replicate.

**What you get with Membership:**
- Reliable managed infrastructure at sustainable cost
- Participation in roadmapping and co-funding opportunities
- [Right to Replicate](https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate) - full control over your infrastructure
- Pool resources with peer organizations to fund shared needs

**What you get with Premier Membership:**
- Everything in Membership, plus:
- Strategic engagement and direction over our roadmap
- Dedicated coordination for technical improvements
- Tighter feedback loop between your needs and our development

### For the open science ecosystem (funders, OSS maintainers, advocates)

**Turn usage into investment. Drive systemic change.**

We demonstrate that community-governed infrastructure is a scalable, reliable alternative to proprietary silos.

**What we enable:**
- **Strengthen OSS sustainability**: Usage becomes active investment in the tools research depends on
- **Spread innovation**: Best practices and tools flow rapidly across disciplinary boundaries
- **Prove the alternative**: Scalable, community-driven infrastructure without vendor lock-in
