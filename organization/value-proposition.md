```{pull-quote}
2i2c co-creates a virtuous cycle: we support communities with managed infrastructure to power their science, and reinvest their resources to strengthen the open source tools we all depend on.
```

2i2c's virtuous cycle of co-creation: we provide communities access to shared data, computing, and tools to co-create discoveries, which generates resources to support open source communities, which leads to technology enhancements that benefit everyone and that we can deploy to our community network. This continuous co-creation between science communities and open source communities sustains and grows the impact of open infrastructure.

## Our value to stakeholders

### For research & education communities

**For hub users:** One-click access to pre-configured environments with scalable resources. Focus on your research and teaching, not infrastructure.

**For hub administrators:** Self-service customization, user management, and monitoring. Control your configuration with expert guidance when needed.

**For community leaders:** Expert cloud partnership with transparent costs and the Right to Replicate (no vendor lock-in). Access shared investments and a network of peer communities that amplify your impact.

### For the open science ecosystem

**Strengthen open-source toolchains** by connecting scientific needs directly to software development.

**Break down silos** by spreading innovation and best practices across institutional and disciplinary boundaries.

**Prove community-driven infrastructure works** as a powerful alternative to proprietary platforms.
