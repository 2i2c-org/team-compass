# Value proposition

Here’s our core value proposition

```{pull-quote}
2i2c supports a network of communities with interactive computing hubs to power their science, and invests in the open source tools that help our communities create and share knowledge.
```

2i2c creates a virtuous cycle between open science communities that **create knowledge** and open source communities that **build the tools** to do so.

* For **open science communities** in research and education, we provide managed cloud hubs built entirely with open-source software. This gives them the power to create and share knowledge, the freedom to control their own digital infrastructure, and a network of peers to learn from.  
* For **open-source communities**, we grow their impact by making their tools more accessible, and provide sustainable contributions and strategic guidance. Resources from the communities we serve are directly reinvested to strengthen the open tools we all depend on.

This creates a self-sustaining engine for impact: better science and education leads to healthier open source, which in turn enables better science and education.
