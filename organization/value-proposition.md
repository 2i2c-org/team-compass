# Value proposition

```{pull-quote}
2i2c co-creates a virtuous cycle with a network of communities: we support research communities with interactive computing hubs to power their learning and discovery, and reinvest their resources into open source communities to strengthen the tools that the world uses to create and share knowledge.
```

2i2c's virtuous cycle of co-creation: we provide communities access to shared data, computing, and tools to co-create discoveries, which generates resources to support open source communities, which leads to technology enhancements that benefit everyone and that we can deploy to our community network. This continuous co-creation between science communities and open source communities sustains and grows the impact of open infrastructure.

## Our value to stakeholders

### For research & education communities

**For hub users:** Instant, standardized access. Get the same battle-tested infrastructure used by top research communities globally. Focus on your science, not the server.

**For hub administrators:** Customize your hub using tools and workflows co-developed by the scientific community. Instantly benefit from open source enhancements and learn from a network of administrators like you.

**For community leaders:** Control your infrastructure with the [Right to Replicate](https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate). Join a network of peer organizations that pool resources to fund the open source tools you rely on.

### For the open science ecosystem

**Strengthen the open source ecosystem**. We turn the _usage_ of open source into active investment. By connecting scientific needs directly to upstream development, we ensure the tools powering research are sustainable and responsive.

**Spread innovation across community silos**. We break down the barriers between institutions and domains. Our shared infrastructure and member service allows best practices, workflows, and new tools to spread rapidly across disciplinary boundaries.

**Establish a robust community-driven alternative**. We demonstrate that community-governed infrastructure is a scalable, reliable choice. We offer a proven path for research communities to operate at scale without proprietary lock-in.
