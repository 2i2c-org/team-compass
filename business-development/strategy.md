# 2i2c Business Strategy: Learning to Scale Co-Creation

We are in the process of refining our business strategy.
We'll update the content in the team compass over the coming weeks.

This Google Doc: [Business plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HgSqAWeZZjcph3eHuWfv56WYopEHwrtmb-pAL3wMxco/edit?tab=t.7m8j6wkb7byt) has the latest version of our Business Plan.

Over time we are adapting content from that plan for the team compass.

## Where We Are Today

2i2c is in a discovery phase between two business models:
- **What we were**: A consultancy providing bespoke JupyterHub deployments
- **What we're becoming**: A convener of communities that co-create open source infrastructure while receiving reliable managed services

We are not pivoting to become a pure SaaS company. We are intentionally exploring how to scale community-driven co-creation.

## Our Strategic Hypothesis

**The value 2i2c provides = Reliable Infrastructure × Community Co-Creation Capability**

Customers pay for memberships not just for hubs, but for:
- Dependable cloud infrastructure that "just works and is customizable for my community"
- Expertise in open source tools and workflows
- Connection to a network of communities solving similar problems
- Ability to influence and co-create shared solutions
- Pathways to funding collaborative development

## Our Membership Tiers: Who They Serve

Our three-tier membership structure is a learning scaffold, not an end state. Each tier represents different levels of engagement in co-creation:

### Essential ($5K/year) → The Instructor

**Who**: Teachers of introductory data science courses dealing with 20-1000 students on diverse laptops

**Their Challenge**: "How do I get everyone on the same toolchain without spending the first three weeks on installation troubleshooting?"

**What They Buy**:
- Equalized cloud-based computing environment
- Content distribution systems (nbgitpuller + git repos) that let them broadcast interactive lessons instantly

**Co-Creation Role**: Educational content creators who benefit from and contribute to shared educational resources

**Key Insight**: They want to teach data science, not manage infrastructure. Speed and simplicity matter most.

### Advanced ($15K/year) → The Principal Investigator

**Who**: Research group leaders conducting disciplinary science around shared data resources (NASA satellites, research instruments) or computational methods (Volcano models, ocean currents)

**Their Challenge**: "How do we reduce friction in collaborative research and make our work reproducible without everyone becoming DevOps experts?"

**What They Buy**:
- Flexible infrastructure that adapts as research questions evolve
- Partnership in co-creating toolchain and data integration improvements
- Configurations that enable collaboration around specific data/methods

**Co-Creation Role**: Contributors who share disciplinary knowledge, shape community priorities, and participate in collaborative development

**Key Insight**: Their research needs drive the evolution of their tools. They'll invest time in improving shared infrastructure if it accelerates their science.

### Premier (Custom pricing) → The Systems Leader

**Who**: Chief Research Officers, Institute Directors, Provosts, Directors of Teaching & Learning Centers—leaders who enable other leaders

**Their Challenge**: "How do I create horizontal infrastructure that serves all disciplines/programs efficiently while integrating with our existing investments and elevating our institution's standing?"

**What They Care About**:
- **Cost efficiency**: Decreasing cloud costs across all users
- **Integration**: Federating with HPC centers, on-prem systems, LMS, existing edtech
- **ROI**: Getting new value from prior infrastructure investments
- **Governance**: Federated budgeting, usage attribution, information security
- **Positioning**: Being recognized as open science/education leaders; institutional brand elevation

**What They Buy**:
- Strategic partnership that makes them look good (to boards, funders, peer institutions)
- Horizontal solutions that work across disciplinary verticals
- Access to a network that enhances institutional prestige
- Influence on ecosystem direction

**Co-Creation Role**: Conveners and funders of collaborative development that benefits the whole network

**Key Insight**: They're doing metascience—their job is creating conditions for others to succeed. They value strategic partnership and network positioning as much as technical solutions.

## Our Strategic Shift

We are moving from reactive project work to proactive co-creation:

**Instead of**: Customer requests → Custom solution → Siloed knowledge

**Moving to**: Shared challenges → Collaborative development → Network benefits

This means convening Premier members to identify common needs, facilitating joint funding, and ensuring solutions benefit the entire network.
