## Sources of Truth (where we store information)

Business development stores information across different software platforms.

### Project management

The [BD Team Board](https://github.com/orgs/2i2c-org/projects/61/views/1?filterQuery=) Github project board is used to track tasks and activities that pertain to:

-   Operationalizing BD's strategy
-   Creating content supporting content (e.g. sales or marketing assets)
-   Improving the effectiveness of the team's processes.

Additionally, BD related initiatives will be found on this board. Occasionally, some tasks are replicated on [Delivery Enablement/Operations](https://github.com/orgs/2i2c-org/projects/50/views/14) board because a member of that team is tasked with operationalizing the work.

### Deal and CRM information

We currently use Hubspot for managing our Sales/Deals pipeline. We previously used a custom built Airtable solution and are pivoting to Hubspot. All new Deals and sales opportunities should be stored in Hubspot with links back out to Airtable.

### Engagement project management

We use Airtable to manage Engagements. The primary interface is the [Engagement interface](https://airtable.com/appbjBTRIbgRiElkr/pagpZcdEaghJQiYH3).
The [Engagement management](engagement.md) section goes into greater details about this delivery stage.
