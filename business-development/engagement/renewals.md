# Renewals

We use the Sales **CRM > Engagements** interface to quickly surface information about Engagements.

There are five types of views on this interface:

-   _Lapsed_: Engagements who's service agreement have expired but we are still providing them with services.
-   _Needs Renewal_: Engagements with service agreements that will be expiring within 3-months.
-   _Active_: The list of engagements with valid services agreements and we are actively supporting their communities.
-   _Ready for Decommissioning_: Lhe list of engagements with service agreements that have ended and we are planning to decommission their hubs.
-   _Ended of Renewed_: Historical engagements

## Process for identify Renewal Opportunities

Services agreements that have a contract end date 3-months away from expiring are considered "Active & needs renewal".
These engagements are flagged with the "Active & needs renewal" status during the Project Management alignment meeting or by a member of the Delivery Enablement team.
