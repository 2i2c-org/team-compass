# Creating alignment

We use several meetings to create alignment and coordinate business development across our teams.
These meetings are currently:

-   Sales Sync (_[BizDev: Sales Sync](meetings/sales-sync.md)_)
-   Product Sync (_[BizDev - Product Sync](meetings/product-sync.md)_)
-   Project Management alignment (_[P&S: Project Management](meetings/project-management-alignment.md)_)
-   Horizon Scanning (_[P&S: Horizon Scanning](meetings/horizon-scanning.md)_)

### Process related alignment

We work in iterations and use Agile delivery practices to deliver our work.
This naturally results in the following ceremonies:

**Planning**
We kick-off iterations with a planning ceremony, identifying the work that we need to complete for the iteration.
The outcome of these planning meetings are captured on the [BD Team Board](https://github.com/orgs/2i2c-org/projects/61/views/1?filterQuery=).

**Sync/checking**
We have two, 15 minute synchronous checkins each week. These help us to:

-   Communicate if we are still on track to meeting the iteration's goals
-   Proactively pivot or redistribute focus/capacity based on challenges or new information
-   Identify and resolve blockers

**Continuous improvement**
We have a retrospective at the end of each iteration to provide opportunities to improve our way of working.
