# HubSpot Usage (2026)

## Overview

We use HubSpot as our Single Source of Truth for tracking Deals and related sales motions (e.g. Renewals, prospects, general sales inquiries, etc.).
In late 2025, we decided to migrate away from Airtable to HubSpot. We've kept historical data in Airtable and will be deleting the data in mid-2026.

## Current Prorcess

Below are a common list of processes that are frequently done in HubSpot.

1. Creating a new Deal
2. Adding Contracts to Deals
3. Enriching Deals and Contacts
4. Linking HubSpot to Asana
