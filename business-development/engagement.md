# Engagement management

2i2c's **Engagement management** is a sub-step of the [Sales Operation's](sales-operations.md) Delivery stage and includes activities required to manage delivery commitments (including reporting), ensuring that customers derive value from 2i2c's offerings.

The structure of 2i2c's Engagement management workflow (linking CRM and Delivery Enablement)
:::

## Why this structure

Broadly, our sales processes span two main flows:

-   **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)** - This covers Pre-sales and Sales stages, championed by the Business Development team
-   **Delivery** - This covers everything in the Delivery stage. The Delivery Enablement and P&S teams are the champions.

Consequently, we need distinct engagement and project activities to improve delivery management, reporting and collaboration between the teams.

Implicit to the structure are the following:

1. The end-to-end delivery of community value is the responsibility of multiple teams within 2i2c
1. The Business Development (BD) team triggers the creation of delivery work after a customer agreement is created and,
1. The delivery of value requires distinct units of work (i.e. Engagement, Project and Project Deliverables, etc.)
1. The Delivery Enablement team can trigger renewal conversation in the BD team.

## Relationship between work activities

A successful sale (closed-won), triggers a sequence of processes in the Delivery Enablement and Product and Services team.

Below we identify the relationship between the different units of work in more detail.

**1. Opportunity management**

The Opportunity management process (also referred to as Customer Relationship Management (CRM) pipeline) governs how we acquire customers (opportunity to paying customer).

CRM Opportunity management
:::

Within 2i2c, there are two types of Opportunities:

-   New Opportunities

    -   Each _Closed-Won_ Opportunity, must have at least one contract or an MOU in Airtable
    -   Only _Closed-Won_ Opportunities get assigned Engagements
    -   A _Closed-Won_ Opportunity can only have one Engagement

-   Renewal Opportunities
    -   These opportunities can automatically get an Engagements without an Memorandums of understanding (MoUs) or Contracts

**2. Engagement management**

Within 2i2c, Engagement management simply tries to determine: _Did we actually deliver all of the commitments?_

This results in a workflow that allows us to answer sustainability questions that include:

-   _What things_ do we need to deliver?
-   _When will we deliver_ those things?
-   Some agreements have FTE clauses. Did we deliver on those?
-   Can we _extend the existing relationship_?

**We don't only care about the 2i2c side of things.**

From a communities perspective Engagement Management means:

1. Are we delivering value to communities?
2. What's the health of all of the active contracts?
3. Which satisfaction metric of our product offerings?
