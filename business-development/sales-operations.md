# Sales Operations

Our sales operations are divided into five distinct stages. These are described below.

## Leads

The **Leads** stage includes activities needed to educate the market about our products and services. It also serves the ancillary purpose of connecting communities and sharing knowledge with the science and open source ecosystems.

Marketing is a sub-process of the Leads stage. It involves content creation and curation. The key artefacts generated at this stage include:

-   Shareable assets
-   Social media posts

## Sales

The **Sales** stage consists of two sub-processes, namely Pre-sales and Sales.

The _pre-sales process_ focuses on the identification of possible customers/communities for our Business Development team to engage.

The _sales process_ focuses on moving the customers/communities through our CRM pipeline. The CRM pipeline is a workflow that consists of the following stages:

1. **Qualifying** - Establishes if a community presents a possible _sales opportunity_.
1. **Prospecting** - Allows us to filter and prioritise "sales opportunities" that can benefit from our products and services that could become future customers.
1. **Partnering** - Finalises the statement of work that needs to be delivered by 2i2c to the future-customer/community for them to realise value from our partnership.
1. **Invoicing** - Presents the future-customer with a contract or Memorandum of understanding (MoU) and an invoice that allows us to get paid. This formally moves the future-customer to a 2i2c customer relationship.

The key artefacts generated at this stage include:

-   Proposals
-   Quotes
-   Signed Agreement
-   Partner onboarding
-   [Asana](#delivery:asana) (2i2c <> CS&S)
-   HelloSign (CS&S)
-   Invoice (CS&S)
-   Airtable (CS&S)

### Delivery

The **Delivery** stage is used to "roll-out" the products and services to our customers. The stage involves multi-steps that requiring close collaboration with the P&S team and Delivery Enablement team.

The steps include the following:

1. **Provisioning** - This step kicks-off activities that ensure effective project management of our contractual obligations (see [Engagement management](engagement.md)). The key artefacts here are: AirTable records; and a Statement of Work (SoW).

1. **Ongoing services** delivery - At this step, we generate tasks that are provisioned via the P&S Team's delivery process. Additionally, we provide infrastructure monitoring and support at this step. Key artefacts are P&S Backlog items and delivery commitments.

1. **Milestone reporting** - The final sub-step for delivery is Impact reporting. This helps 2i2c and our customers (and their communities) evaluate if we met the goals of the contracts (or grants). Key artefacts are reports.

### Renewals

Finally, the **Renewals** stage focuses on renewing or extending our collaboration and partnership with our existing customers/communities.

The key artefacts here are:

-   Usage reports
-   Agreement renewals
-   Decommission requests.

The image below provides an overview of all the stages.
