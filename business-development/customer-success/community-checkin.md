# Community Check-in

Purpose: To learn the value received by a community for community retention, upgrades, referrals, and participation in storytelling, ultimately benefiting 2i2c and its brand. To gain insights into whether, how and to what extent 2i2c’s platforms and services solve problems for the community. The check-in gives structured “voice of customer” information that helps 2i2c improve business, product and delivery activities.

## Process

1. BD schedules Community Check-in with the Community
2. Meeting Agenda (60 min)
  - Ice-breaker question **"What's something that you hope to get out of this meeting?"**
  - BD gives 10 min summary on 2i2c value proposition and shows how the community has used our product and services (using information provided by PS)

  - Content level questions
    - **How happy are you with the service?**
    - **How actively is your community using your hub(s)?**
    - **What's the most useful aspect of the service?**
    - **What could we change to improve your community's experience?**
    - **What's the coolest thing you've done with the service?** (follow up: **May we co-write a case study or showcase your work?**)
  - **What questions do you have that 2i2c can help answer?**
  - Ask open-ended and generative questions to encourage storytelling and understand their experiences, such as **"What's the most interesting thing you like?"** or **"What's something you wish you could do with your hub?"**

3. After check-in

  - BD emails participants to thank them for their time.
  - Create GitHub issues to track any business, product, or support issues that come out of the check-in
  - Share summary of check-in with the 2i2c team
