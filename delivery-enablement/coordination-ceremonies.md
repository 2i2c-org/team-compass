# Creating alignment

We use several meetings to create alignment and coordinate business development across our teams.
These meetings are currently:

-   Operations Planning (_[Review Operations Board](meetings/operations-planning.md)_)
-   Operations Sync (_[Operations Alignment and Sync](meetings/operations-sync.md)_)
-   Retrospective (_[Delivery Enablement/Operations Retro](meetings/retrospective.md)_)
