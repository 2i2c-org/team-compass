```{role} People Lead

```

(role:people-lead)=

**_TL;DR;_** The People Lead is accountable for shaping strategies and processes crucial for fostering a supportive and growth-oriented work environment. They support and advise our teams while also managing the day-to-day people practices that shape our organizational ethos.

## AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY & OUTCOMES

-   **Care for and grow people:** Their primary goal is to strategically support and advise our people, ensuring their well-being, growth, and effectiveness within a unique, globally distributed working model.

-   **Build and run our agile**[^1] **people practices:** The secondary goal is to act as a trusted advisor and operational expert for all people-related matters within the organization, providing coaching and guidance to people managers, designing and implementing structured, lightweight and responsive processes, and facilitating seamless operations.

-   **Advise and support Executive Direction and leadership team, to make organizational work successful:** They play an active role in guiding change, so that we can tackle big changes and initiatives and build the organization we want to have in the future.

-   **Provide expertise and capacity to teams & leading from the center:** They're a hands-on supporter who lends capacity to every team. They're also a member of the leadership team, a facilitator and contributor to strategic initiatives.

Caring for our people is not an isolated function within 2i2c.

## FAILURE MODE

We know the **People Lead** is failing if team members are all overwhelmed and burned out, aren't getting feedback, and are quitting.

## KEY OUTCOMES

1. **Care for and grow people**
    1. Improved well-being, engagement and team cohesion (monitored through conversations or surveys)
    2. New team members are onboarded effectively
2. **People growth:** help team members grow skills that support 2i2c needs and their personal goals
    1. Increased focus and skill around people management & leadership
    2. All team members have clear expectations and feedback on their performance
    3. Team members and managers are able to make development plans that embrace a growth mindset
3. **Other elements of building and running 2i2c's People function**,
    1. Working with CS&S, we maintain team members' records in a way that maximizes autonomy and care for individuals while minimizing toil
    2. Team members can use the policies and practice we put in place with relative ease
4. **Advise and support Executive Director and leadership team **
    1. Foster growth of leadership stance
    2. Contribute to strategy and scale, with particular attention to guiding change in a way that reflects our culture and care for each other
5. **Provide expertise and "burst capacity" in people management to teams**
    1. Fill in people management capacity when teams lack it (for example - coach team members, design roles, co-create development plans)
    2. Partner with managers and teams to resolve people management challenges

## LINE-MANAGEMENT

The People Lead reports to the Chief of Staff.

## KEY TOUCH POINTS

-   All people managers (coaching them to grow skills and work with them to make sure we're consistent and fair in our people practices)
-   CS&S HR: Jamille White (to borrow and share people management practices and avoid reinventing wheels)
-   Individual team members (guiding and supporting change and also offering people advice, coaching and an escalation point for people-related matters)

## 3-MONTHS GOALS

[Current: Review March 2025]

1. Everyone has clear expectations for their roles
2. Everyone has had a meaningful performance review with their manager, their previous manager and the people lead
3. Cost of living adjustments for employee salaries and contract renewals

## Notes

[^1]: Note the "little a" agile - this doesn't marry us to using agile delivery practices, but does set an expectation that our people practices are lightweight, responsive and designed around our people.
