# Delivery Enablement team KPIs

We’ll measure our success as a delivery enablement team by assessing each of these key areas.

-   **Improve value delivery efficiency and effectiveness**
    -   Reduce cost of doing business & operational effectiveness (cycle time from lead to delivery, cost of services or cost to deliver a project)
    -   Positive contribution to customer value
    -   Ensure 2i2c financial health is being tracked
-   **Healthy team function - well-being and engagement**
    -   Positive team engagement (survey internally)
    -   Meeting targets for time off metrics (leading indicator of team well-being & burnout avoidance)
    -   Team member onboarding effectiveness (time to first PR, etc)
-   **Reduce capability gaps in teams**
    -   Critical roles are staffed
    -   Teams have all the skills and capacity needed to function effectively
    -   People are growing in ways that support our organizational direction
-   **Improve decision making across 2i2c**
    -   lead-time (how long do initiatives take to get to done?) is known
    -   How easily can we access Business Intelligence information to make crucial decisions (qualitative)? Example:
        -   do we know if we have enough money to run the organization
        -   Do we know how many of the projects are close to 80% completed?
        -   Can we list the projects that are at risk?

## How we think about goals

We use the thinking prompts below to determine how to set goals.

**What do we want to see / feel in 6 months?:**

_Current: Review end of March 2025_

-   We know where we stand: ability to measure org health
-   We know where we’re going: we have clear mid-term (6-12 month) priorities
-   We aren’t there yet: we don’t expect to have reached our overarching strategic goals, like long-term sustainability

**What things we will probably do?: **

_Current: Review end of March 2025_

-   Baseline ops practices set up, so we can measure and improve things
    -   Agree on and implement highest priority people practices
    -   Build up CRM and Sales ops
    -   Ensure systems of work exist for project delivery (i.e. end-to-end from sales to project enablement)
-   Measure and communicate team maturity using assessments?
