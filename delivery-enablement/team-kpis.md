# Delivery Enablement team KPIs

We’ll measure our success as a delivery enablement team by assessing each of these key areas.

-   **Improve value delivery efficiency and effectiveness**
    -   Reduce cost of doing business
    -   Increase operational effectiveness (cycle time from lead to delivery, cost of services or cost to deliver a project)
    -   Positive contribution to community value
    -   Ensure 2i2c financial health is being tracked
-   **Healthy team function - well-being and engagement**
    -   Positive team engagement (survey internally)
    -   Meeting targets for time off metrics (leading indicator of team well-being & burnout avoidance)
    -   Team member onboarding effectiveness (time to first PR, etc), when we hire
-   **Reduce capability gaps in teams**
    -   Critical roles are staffed
    -   Teams have all the skills and capacity needed to function effectively
    -   People are growing in ways that support our organizational direction
-   **Improve decision making across 2i2c**
    -   Lead-time (how long do initiatives take to get to done?) is known
    -   How easily can we access Business Intelligence information to make crucial decisions (qualitative)? Example:
        -   do we know if we have enough money to run the organization
        -   Do we know how many of the projects are close to 80% completed?
        -   Can we list the projects that are at risk?

## How we think about goals

Delivery Enablement is a support function, so we define our goals and objectives in support of other functions.
