# Using Productboard for prioritization

2i2c uses [Productboard](https://productboard.com/) to manage product and services prioritization and collect insights relevant to our product and services improvement process. This is where the roadmaps are maintained.

For those unfamiliar with Productboard, [see this short primer on Productboard](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UkFcv2klEBOEnZ4CoB7PnVYS6MNOn5fCfM7unbco2lI/edit?usp=sharing).
This should help you navigate and contribute your input into the Product Delivery Flow.
