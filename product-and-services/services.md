## What are services?

A **service** at 2i2c is an organized set of procedures and resources that generate value for community stakeholders, 
aligning with 2i2c’s mission to enable open science and collaborative research through a global network of
community hubs for interactive learning and discovery. Qualities of a service:

- A scalable, repeatable activity that is defined by its outcome and has a clear value to the communities we serve.
- Has to have a direct benefit or value to a community member or leader, as well as clear beneficiary archetypes.
- Can be costed internally for the purposes of maintaining scalability and sustainability for 2i2c.  
- Can (but does not necessarily have to be) monetized on a cost x time basis, or bundled as a membership benefit.
- Has a clear and scalable process which is well documented and does not rely on a single individual to execute.
