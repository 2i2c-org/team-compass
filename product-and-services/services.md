- Has to have a direct customer benefit and one or more customer beneficiary archetypes.
- Can be costed internally for the purposes of maintaining scalability and sustainability for 2i2c.  
- Can (but does not necessarily have to be) monetized on a cost x time basis, or bundled as a membership benefit.
