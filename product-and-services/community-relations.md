# Community Relations

2i2c’s differentiator is the combination of our technical expertise along with social knowledge across both science and education communities, as well as open source communities. We call the social side of that work _Community Relations_, which is focused on growing members’ collective impact. Community Relations is a collection of processes and services provided by the Product & Services team; it's not a separate team.  

## Elements of Community Relations
There are four key elements of Community Relations, all supporting member communities' collective impact through our shared infrastructure.Our core infrastructure service is a reliable, functional part of science and education community building. The technical aspects of our service delivery are documented in our services and infrastructure docs. Community Relations work supports communities' use of our core service.  

Today (early 2026) many of these elements are more ad hoc than we would like, which makes it challenging for communities to engage with us and with each other. We'll be building and refining Community Relations throughout 2026; early thoughts are captured in our [services strategy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1djix1YrzMRxc7rketJLXgl-R3g8kplljPPCbWIMmh0o/edit?tab=t.ktsf3e28gj1x#heading=h.eldsuysfzza2_).

### Community Experience & Enablement  
This element focuses on the product itself. How good is the documentation? How quickly can a community get from "zero" to "hello world"? They advocate for all 2i2c member communities back to the product team. Part of how we do this today is via hands-on work in support of communities, so this overlaps significantly with service delivery (onboarding, community enablement, offboarding).
- Welcoming new communities and helping them navigate the service
- 1:1 problem solving / [community enablement](https://compass.2i2c.org/services/community-enablement/)
- Other forms of learning together 
- Offboarding & handoff 

### Network Effect  
This involves hands-on community management and curation, nurturing the places where communities gather, like a Discord server, forum, or GitHub. It's about fostering connections between member communities, not just to them. Important point: this needs to be achievable within 2i2c's means.
- Shaping and enabling collaboration across boundaries
- Showcases & early access to new infra & docs
- Help communities showcase their own work 

### Co-funding and Co-creation  
This is collaborative, hands-on work with one or many communities to build, test, upstream and learn about new platform & service features. As such it overlaps significantly with platform delivery (new features in the product process, project management of feature delivery).
- Dedicated, delivery management for complex community engagement
- Previewing, influencing and seeing progress on 2i2c's roadmap
- Refining and shaping work together

### Advocacy: Sharing knowledge to shape the future  
We advocate for the product - platform & services - to open science and education communities. We also advocate for those communities in the wider world. Because of the unique position of 2i2c, this also overlaps significantly with upstream advocacy with and for Jupyter. This is our collective technical expertise deployed to create content (blogs, tutorials), speak at conferences, and create demos. 
- Upstream leadership & navigation assistance
- Sharing and supporting community building work in and across communities
