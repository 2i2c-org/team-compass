# Documentating product features

(minimally-documented)=
## Our minimal definition of "documented"

The following things must exist to meet our definition of **Minimum Viable Documentation**. Product initiatives are not complete until these criteria are met. This applies equally to platform functionality and services.

### User and value documentation

In a [source of truth for user documentation](../operations/documentation.md), provide information along the template defined in [our minimal viable documentation guidelines](inv:docs#mvp).

### Team operations documentation

In a [source of truth for team documentation](../operations/documentation.md), provide information for others on the team to operate, maintain, and enhance this functionality. Here's a template you can use:


```md
(a-myst-label)=
# A short, discoverable page title or section header

A sentence explaining the functionality [that is documented here](<link to the user documentation>)

## How to set-up / operate / deliver / etc

All the necessary information for a member of the same team to learn more about how to perform, maintain, or understand the feature / service. It should be enough for another team member to get started and figure it out themselves without requiring the author to give missing context.
