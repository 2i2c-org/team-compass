# Key Performance Indicators

## Overview

The Product and Services team at 2i2c tracks its value delivery and performance through a set of [Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)](overview.md#kpis). These KPIs help us measure our effectiveness in delivering products and services to meet the needs of our communities.

## Primary KPIs

(kpi:csat)=
### Community Satisfaction Score (CSAT)

We gather Community Satisfaction Scores (CSAT) (or User Satisfaction Scores) to understand whether we're delivering value to our communities.
We do so by including links to brief surveys in our communications with communities.

#### When and where do we use CSAT scores?

There are three main touch points for gathering user satisfaction scores:

1. Quarterly updates
2. Feature release blogs
3. Targeted community feedback from co-designed solutions

A lightweight report highlighting key insights is generated on a monthly basis by P&S to be shared with the wider team. This task will appear as a recurrent, auto-generated issue on the P&S board.

#### How to generate a new CSAT survey

Google survey templates for each type can be found in the [2i2c Team Drive > Product > Community Satisfaction](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1jF8QrvY-zXLmzlbgTMh6Nlsw7O1R2X8i).
Check the [CSAT `README` file](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bH5fN2lXcZ-vjQ4Pb4lfaeQbmoCBkN1QYjA7ZaxkmsY/edit?usp=sharing) in the [2i2c Team Drive > Product > Community Satisfaction](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1jF8QrvY-zXLmzlbgTMh6Nlsw7O1R2X8i) folder for more details on how to use these templates and generate reports.
