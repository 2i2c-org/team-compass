# Key Performance Indicators

## Overview

The Product and Services team at 2i2c tracks its value delivery and performance through a set of [Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)](overview.md#kpis). These KPIs help us measure our effectiveness in delivering products and services to meet the needs of our communities.

## Primary KPIs

### User Satisfaction Score

There are three main touchpoints for gathering user satisfaction scores:

1. Quarterly updates
2. Feature release blogs
3. Targeted community feedback from co-designed solutions

Google survey templates for each type can be found in the [2i2c Team Drive > Product > Community Satisfaction](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1jF8QrvY-zXLmzlbgTMh6Nlsw7O1R2X8i). Please check the `README` file in that folder for more details on how to use these templates.
