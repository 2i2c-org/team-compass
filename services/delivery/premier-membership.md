# Premier Membership Engagement

Communities with Premier membership co-create new ideas and impact with 2i2c and each other. To facilitate that co-creation and ensure each community has a clear view of the work we're doing, 2i2c hosts regular conversations with them.

## Quarterly showcase and roadmap review 
Each quarter, we showcase member communities' wins and lessons, 2i2c's latest developments and offer a forum to discuss what should be next on our roadmap. 

## Monthly strategy session 
Each community with Premier membership will also be invited to a monthtly session that focuses 2i2c's energy on the community's strategic needs. That conversation can include planning and priority setting for co-created work as well as personalized updates on progress within 2i2c. 

## Collaborative work time 
When we have collaborative work in flight, 2i2c will help match people and projects, pairing strategists or developers who may then have daily, weekly or ad hoc follow up. All work that includes a 2i2c person will be tracked through our system of work.
