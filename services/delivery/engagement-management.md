# Engagement Management

Project Management Tool: Asana

Minimum set of fields for an Engagement encoded in Asana requires:

- Engagement name maps to HubSpot Deal Name
- Engagement maps back to to a HubSpot Deal id an url
- Contract Value is the same as a the HubSpot Deal
- Due Dates (Start / End) match the dates in HubSpot
- Within each project, we should define a 'Template' project for each of
  - Essential Tier Engagement
  - Advanced Tier Engagement
  - Premier Tier Engagement

that encodes the overall structure that we feel are common to each engagement. We can create these templates based on an existing project (once we have converged on what 'good enough' looks like)

One of the default tasks in any engagement should be 'Confirm Renewal with Community' with a due date set to 60 days before the end of the engagement.

Add this this new Engagement to the portfolio of Activate Engagements.
