# Implementation

## Business Development

When a Deal moves to Closed-Won, BD creates the Engagement to define what 2i2c has committed to deliver. Engagements are composed of Projects which describe time- bound outcomes from the engagement.  When Community Enablement is offered under a service agreement, it is encoded as an ‘Allocation’ with

- Allocation start date
- Allocation end date
- Allocation description
- Allocation units of time

This captures what 2i2c has actually committed to a community partner: a shared outcome and goal with the constraints of a certain maximum units of effort in a given period. A Project may have multiple Allocations if the Partnership Service needs to be broken up into over discrete sub-periods of a project. Unused Community Enablement units of time are not normally carried over from one Allocation period to another.

## Reporting

Once a team member has provided time towards a Community Enablement allocation, they need to report, by recording the units of time and a brief description of the work performed. This is encoded as an 'Activity' under the corresponding allocation. The data that needs to be collected are

- Activity team member
- Activity units of time
- Activity description
- Activity date(s)

Activities can be recorded broken down into several entries or reported together as one larger aggregation. It is the responsibility of the assigned team member to record activity performed within two weeks of the activity. Line managers should periodically review recorded assignments and provide oversight to ensure this data is being collected.

Using the data available from Allocations and Activities, automatic monthly reports can be generated to provide transparency to Business Development, Delivery Enablement, Product & Services, and our clients are the state and status of each Community Enablement Service offering.
