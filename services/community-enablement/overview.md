# Overview

The Community Enablement Service supports communities that benefit from collaborative partnership with 2i2c. It allows us to allocate dedicated staff to work closely with a community to reach specific goals. These engagements are time-bound and effort-bound.

```{note}
# Community Enablement
- Foster strong partnerships between 2i2c and community leaders.
- Enable communities to build capacity using open tools.
- Provide dedicated consulting, meeting participation, documentation support, and more.
```

Business Development identifies that a community may benefit from an increased level of service beyond what is offered in our Interactive Computing Service and Technical Support.

The Community Enablement Service is most appropriate where 2i2c is committing to participating in a community or a project with **well defined time bounds on the nature of that commitment**. Some examples may include:

- Dedicated consultation and guidance on open source science and tools
- Dedicated consultation and community participation in open science  
- Regular participation in community led meetings
- Peer support through a dedicated channel
- Configuration of community maintained software environments

The key pieces of information to be clarified when a Community Enablement Service is being offered are

1. The period over which the Community Enablement Service is active;
2. The number of hours (as a proxy for FTE equivalency) being offered;
3. A general description of the nature of work being committed to by 2i2c.

The Community Enablement Service is meant for allocating small fractions of an FTE and not intended to be used for secondments or subcontracting of 2i2c team members. Time (measured in hours) spent on Community Enablement Service needs to represent the capacity consumed by the overall 2i2c team. Internally, 2i2c needs to represent this work as a fraction of our overall team’s capacity and recognize the opportunity cost of context switching.

The following scale is suggested to record, in units of hours, activity performed as part of Community Enablement Service:

- “1” -  Less than an hour of activity. Responding to an email or participating in a short call.
- “2” - An hour long synchronous meeting with a community including additional time for preparation and follow up.
- “3” - Up to two hours of effort on a project such as a code review or document preparation.
- “5” - Half a day’s effort, such as a long co-working session.
- “8” - Full day (“8 hours”) of activity dedicated to a Partnership Service activity

If multiple people are providing a Community Enablement Service concurrently, then the number of units consumed should be increased accordingly.

A unit of effort (even if nominally 1 billable hour) will, in almost all cases, never be exactly equal to one hour of wall clock time. We are not tracking 2i2c team members’ time to the minute. One unit of effort needs to represent not only the front stage activity of the person doing the Partnership Service activity but also the backstage activity of the rest of the team involved in supporting that activity.
