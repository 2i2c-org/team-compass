# Overview

The Community Enablement Service supports communities that benefit from collaborative partnership with 2i2c. It allows us to allocate dedicated staff to work closely with a community to reach specific goals. These engagements are time-bound and effort-bound.

```{note}
# Commmunity Enablement
- Foster strong partnerships between 2i2c and community leaders.
- Enable communities to build capacity using open tools.
- Provide dedicated consulting, meeting participation, documentation support, and more.
```

The communities that 2i2c serves have a variety of needs. For some communities, a streamlined and highly scalable service that is lower cost is a primary objective. For other communities, 2i2c may agree to work in a more collaborative way to achieve shared goals and outcomes.  

When Business Development identifies that a community may benefit from an increased level of service beyond what is offered in our Interactive Computing Service and Technical Support, BD should offer 2i2c's Community Enablement Service as an option.

Community Enablement Service represents an allocation of one or more 2i2c team members to working with a community to achieve a shared objective or outcome.The particular details of the allocation should be broadly understood when the Community Enablement Service is negotiated but BD should reserve the right to make changes (such as the particular 2i2c team members involved) during the Community Enablement Service engagement.

If software engineering or feature development is the goal, a different 2i2c service is more appropriate so that explicit deliverables can be as laid out in a scope of work. Community Enablement Service is most appropriate where 2i2c is committing to participating in a community or a project with **well defined time bounds on the nature of that commitment**. Some examples may include:

- Dedicated consultation and guidance on open source science and tools
- Dedicated consultation and community participation in open science  
- Regular participation in community led meetings
- Peer support through a dedicated channel
- Configuration of community maintained software environments

The key pieces of information to be clarified when a Community Enablement Service is being offered are
1. The period over which the Community Enablement Service is active;
2. The number of hours (as a proxy for FTE equivalency) being offered;
3. A general description of the nature of work being committed to by 2i2c.

Community Enablement Service is meant for allocating small fractions of an FTE and not intended to be used for secondments or subcontracting of 2i2c team members. Time (measured in hours) spent on Community Enablement Service needs to represent the capacity consumed by the overall 2i2c team. Internally, 2i2c needs to represent this work as a fraction of our overall team’s capacity. It needs to recognize the opportunity cost of context switching.

The following scale is suggested to record, in units of hours, activity performed as part of Community Enablement Service:

- “1” -  Less than an hour of activity. Responding to an email or participating in a short call.
- “2” - An hour long synchronous meeting with a community including additional time for preparation and follow up.
- “3” - Up to two hours of effort on a project such as a code review or document preparation.
- “5” - Half a day’s effort, such as a long co-working session.
- “8” - Full day (“8 hours”) of activity dedicated to a Partnership Service activity

If multiple people are providing a Community Enablement Service concurrently, then the number of units consumed should be increased accordingly.

A unit of effort (even if nominally 1 billable hour) will, in almost all cases, never be exactly equal to one hour of wall clock time. We are not tracking 2i2c team members’ time to the minute. One unit of effort needs to represent not only the frontstage activity of the person doing the Partnership Service activity but also the backstage activity of the rest of the team involved in supporting that activity.

## Objective of the Service

2i2c’s mission is to grow a _global network of community hubs for interactive learning and discovery_. The ideal Community Enablement Service project is 2i2c helping research and education communities create and develop an interactive computing platform that gives communities a digital home to create and share knowledge with a global network of communities to learn from.

## Implementation

When a Deal moves to Closed-Won, BD creates the Engagement to define what 2i2c has committed to deliver. Engagements are composed of Projects which describe time- bound outcomes from the engagement.  When Community Enablement is offered under a service agreement, it is encoded as an ‘Allocation’ with

- Allocation start date
- Allocation end date
- Allocation description
- Allocation units of time

This captures what 2i2c has actually committed to a community partner: a shared outcome and goal with the constraints of a certain maximum units of effort in a given period. A Project may have multiple Allocations if the Partnership Service needs to be broken up into over discrete subperiods of a project. Unused Community Enablement units of time are not normally carried over from one Allocation period to another.

Once a team member has provided time towards a Community Enablement allocation, they need to report, by recording the units of time and a brief description of the work performed. This is encoded as an 'Activity' under the corresponding allocation. The data that needs to be collected are

- Activity team member
- Activity units of time
- Activity description
- Activity date(s)

Activities can be recorded broken down into several entries or reported together as one larger aggregation. It is the responsibility of the assigned team member to record activity performed within two weeks of the activity. Line managers should periodically review recorded assignments and provide oversight to ensure this data is being collected.

Using the data available from Allocations and Activities, automatic monthly reports can be generated to provide transparency to Business Development, Delivery Enablement, Product & Services, and our clients are the state and status of each Community Enablement Service offering.
