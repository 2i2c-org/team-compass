### Dedicated delivery management
The social aspects of coordinating work between 2i2c and member communities are vital to community success. We aim to manage work in a way that multiplies community impact - connecting research and education communities to each other, to upstream communities and to 2i2c. 

Dedicated delivery management - or community-specific project management - is an additional service for complex community projects and strategic partnerships. 
Communities using the dedicated delivery management service are assigned a delivery partner who’s responsible for managing co-created OSS via collaborative process and/or work that comes from co-funding the 2i2c roadmap
That delivery partner acts as a project manager and social coordinator, connecting the community to the 2i2c product team and other member communities working on similar efforts

That coordination work is typically estimated and included as part of a Statement of Work or contract. Communities who desire additional project management support can ask for that as part of an engagement, within 2i2c’s capacity.

While each strategic partner has unique needs, dedicated delivery management includes the following key ceremonies: 
Kickoff meeting for your community
Monthly or quarterly strategy session for your community
Co-funding kickoffs for one or many communities who support specific feature delivery
Quarterly showcase with other strategic partner communities
