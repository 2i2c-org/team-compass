# Dedicated delivery management
The social aspects of coordinating work between 2i2c and member communities are vital to community success. We aim to manage work in a way that multiplies community impact - connecting research and education communities to each other, to upstream communities and to 2i2c. 

:::{note} 2i2c team members: if you're planning a delivery management meeting, open a "Dedicated Delivery Management meeting" issue in our infrastructure repo and follow the instructions. :::

Dedicated delivery management - or community-specific project management - is an additional service for complex community projects and strategic partnerships. 
Communities using the dedicated delivery management service are assigned a delivery partner who’s responsible for managing co-created OSS via collaborative process and/or work that comes from co-funding the 2i2c roadmap. The delivery partner acts as a project manager and social coordinator, connecting the community to the 2i2c product team and other member communities working on similar efforts

This coordination work is typically estimated and included as part of a Statement of Work or contract. Communities who desire additional project management support can ask for that as part of an engagement, within 2i2c’s capacity.

While each strategic partner has unique needs, dedicated delivery management includes the following key ceremonies: 
- Kickoff meeting for your community, combined with onboarding 
- Monthly or quarterly strategy session for your community
- Co-funding kickoffs for one or many communities who support specific feature delivery
- Quarterly showcase with other strategic partner communities
- Acknowledgement of the impact we enable together in our stakeholder and public communications


## Kickoff meeting
Goals of the meeting: understand the community’s strategy and desired outcomes, establish first priorities, points of contact, and how we work together. This meeting can happen alongside community onboarding to 2i2c hub(s). 
 
Agenda:
- Most important priorities for the community - could be feature work, strategic co-creation, upcoming events and dates where you need hubs
- Engagement plan with 2i2c - set up meetings, etc

## Co-funding Kickoff
