## Engagements and Sales Processes

Our Services are normally bundled together into Engagements at different Membership Tiers (Essential, Advanced, Premier) which define the level of each service and the features and options available for hubs. 

Business Development is responsible for assembling services together into a Deal which represents the business arrangement that 2i2c has with a community.

:::{note}
See [the Business Development workflow](../../business-development/sales-operations) for our processes around leads, sales, and invoicing.

See [Engagement Management](../../business-development/engagement/) for more documentation on Engagements, Projects, and Deliverables.
:::

Services are delivered to communities as part of an Engagement. To make the components explicit for our cross-functional team, here different Engagement life cycles for communities at different Membership Tiers. Each Engagement represents a bundling of services together that provides value to a community.

:::{note}
Membership Tier Engagements are not a exhaustive list of the possible Engagements that 2i2c can offer. Special projects, grants, and multi-institutional partnerships are also possible that go beyond one of these standardized Membership Tiers.

Business Development, in consultation with other functional areas of 2i2c, is responsible for defining these kind of **Special Engagements**.
