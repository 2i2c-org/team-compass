# Technical Support

This section contains information that our team uses to triage, communicate, and
resolve {term}`Support Requests` that come from communities.

The Product and Services team is responsible for delivering our Technical Support and has the authority to design the system of roles and
processes that defines "support at 2i2c", and to advocate for the resources
needed to fill those roles.
