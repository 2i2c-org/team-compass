# Backfill or update community contacts

Scenario: A already has an Engagement with 2i2c for **Technical Support**. Community Representative information is missing in FreshDesk.

During the sales or renewal process, BD is asked to fill out the field "Community Representatives" *Community* tab on a Deal in HubSpot. For some historical deals and renewals, this process may not have occurred.

This procedure is also used when a community is renewing a previous engagement.

To back fill this missing information:

1. Make an educated guess based on information in HubSpot, previous FreshDesk tickets, and historical community interactions who is likely a Community Representatives (CR), Authorized PR Submitter (PR), and/or Technical Contact (TC)
2. Fill these names in on FreshDesk
3. Send an email to the CRs (use the canned response "Confirmation of Community Representatives for 2i2c hub") to confirm that these are the correct individuals and request changes as required.
4. Update the Community Representatives field in FreshDesk
5. Update the Community Representative field for this Deal in HubSpot

:::{admonition} Freshdesk Communities and Contacts
FreshDesk has the concept of a 'Company' that can be associated independently with both tickets and contacts. We interpret the 'Company' in Freshdesk to mean the 2i2c Community that is being served.

When a ticket comes into FreshDesk is automatically associated with the Community based on the 'Company' of the Community Representative submitting the ticket.

When a new Community is being onboarding, create a new "company" in FreshDesk:

To update the list of Community Representatives, edit the Company:

```

For each Community Representative, create a new Contact entry. Contacts may be affliated with multiple Communities if required:
