# Roles and team structure

Supporting a 2i2c hub is a collaborative process between 2i2c and the community we serve. 

The **Support Team** is one of the main teams in our **Managed JupyterHub Service Team**.

This consists of these main roles: {term}`Support Triager`, {term}`Support Agent`, {term}`Community Representative`s, and {term}`Hub Administrator`s.
