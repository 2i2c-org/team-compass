# Communication channels

## External communication

We use these channels for communicating with external stakeholders like Community Representatives:

- **[support@2i2c.org](mailto:support@2i2c.org)** is our point-of-contact for all support-related external communication.
- **[The 2i2c FreshDesk account](support:freshdesk)** is where we track all support requests and communication.
- **{doc}`the "Get Support" page <docs:support>`** provides guidance that communities may follow to get support.

(support:freshdesk)=
### FreshDesk

We use FreshDesk to manage all of our hub support questions and change requests.
It is at the following URL:

[**`2i2c.freshdesk.com`**](https://2i2c.freshdesk.com/)

Any emails sent to `support@2i2c.org` will be routed to this FreshDesk account, and all team members should have access to it.

[**Canned responses**](https://support.freshdesk.com/en/support/solutions/articles/37577-creating-common-reply-templates-with-canned-responses) allow us to pre-populate common responses for many kinds of support.

## Internal communication

We have a few channels for communicating around support requests:

- Our [FreshDesk account](https://2i2c.freshdesk.com/a/) allows for internal team communication via the {guilabel}`Add Note` button. This can be useful for sharing quick internal updates.
- The [Eng & Prod board that collects support-related issues](https://github.com/orgs/2i2c-org/projects/22/views/47) identified via metadata `type==support`.
- (deprecated) [Issues with the {guilabel}`support` label](https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Asupport+sort%3Aupdated-desc) were where we tracked support requests related to {term}`Change Requests` and {term}`Guidance Requests`.
