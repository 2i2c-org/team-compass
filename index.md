# The 2i2c Team Compass

This Team Compass is a guide for team members of 2i2c to navigate our organization and community[^team-compass].
It is our team's primary knowledge base.

**The Team Compass is the {term}`Source of Truth`!**

## Structure of the Team Compass

### Major sections

The team compass is roughly divided into four sections:

-   [Organizational documents](index:organizational-documents) are relevant to the entire organization.
    Everything from our mission and values, to our processes for administration.
-   [Functional Areas](index:functional-areas) are major focus areas of 2i2c that have their own practices and roles.
-   [Managed JupyterHub Service](index:hubs-service) is cross-functional documentation aimed at describing our Managed JupyterHub Service processes.
-   [Reference](index:reference) collects reference material, lists, and guides for doing many things across 2i2c.

### Common pages in each section

Each of our top-level sections tends to have one or more of the same four pages:

-   **Scope and responsibilities** (`overview.md`) describes the major focus areas and responsibility for this area.
-   **Structure and roles** (`structure.md`) describes any formal roles, job titles, and team structures for this area.
-   **Workflow** (`workflow.md`) describes how this area coordinates and works with one another.
-   **Governance** (`governance.md`) how this area makes decisions, and what roles have decision-making authority if any non-standard structure is used.
-   **Strategy** (`strategy.md`) describes the major approach that this area takes towards its work and accomplishing its goals.

Below you'll find a list of the sections in our Team Compass.
