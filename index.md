 The 2i2c Team Compass

This team compass defines the policies and practices for 2i2c.

**The Team Compass is the {term}`Source of Truth`!**. Here's a breakdown of responsibility, and see [](./operations/team-compass.md) for background.

- **Overall structure**: The [Delivery Enablement](#delivery-enablement) team along with the [](./organization/role/executive-director.md) is responsibile for the system and structure of the Team Compass.
- **Organization-wide** sections apply to the entire organization. The Executive Director, [Delivery Enablement](#delivery-enablement), and [People Operations](#people-operations) teams are responsible for these sections, but all team members are encouraged to contribute.
- **Functional areas** are a way for teams to define their own practices, policies, and team documentation. The leads of each area are responsible for the content of these sections.
- **Services** are the community facing procedures and processes we perform on behalf of our member communities.

:::{admonition} Authority can be delegated outside of the team compass!
If an external space is a better location for information, add a short sentence delegating authority over a particular topic externally. For example, the [review and merge policy](#development:merge-policy) is delegated to the [`/infrastructure` repository](https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure).

## Services

2i2c oversees a single major effort: supporting our communities by interactive computing with open source infrastructure that is accessible and scalable.

We deliver on this effort through a collection of community facing services.  
We act as a cross-functional team around these services, and share many responsibilities and duties.
Overviews and detailed 2i2c processes of our services are documented in the sections below.
