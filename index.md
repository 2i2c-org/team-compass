# The 2i2c Team Compass

This Team Compass is a guide for team members of 2i2c to navigate our organization and community.
It is the {term}`source of truth <Single Source of Truth>` for information about 2i2c.

## How to use the team compass

2i2c team members should document everything relevant to operating the organization in the 2i2c team compass, and give it precedence over all other kinds of documentation unless explicitly stated otherwise in the team compass.

**The Team Compass is the source of truth!**

Any information that is in this team compass should be considered the **source of truth** for 2i2c. Its information should be complete and updated frequently.

If you see information here that is out of date, please propose an edit in [the team compass repository](https://github.com/2i2c-org/team-compass).

See below for a brief overview of each section of the Team Compass, or browse the sections to the left on your own.
