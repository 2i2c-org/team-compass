# The 2i2c Team Compass

This team compass defines the policies and practices for 2i2c.

**The Team Compass is the {term}`Source of Truth`!**. Here's a breakdown of responsibility, and see [](./operations/team-compass.md) for background.

- **Overall structure**: The [Delivery Enablement](#delivery-enablement) team along with the [](./organization/role/executive-director.md) is responsibile for the system and structure of the Team Compass.
- **Organization-wide** sections apply to the entire organization. The Executive Director, [Delivery Enablement](#delivery-enablement), and [People Operations](#people-operations) teams are responsible for these sections, but all team members are encouraged to contribute.
- **Functional areas** are a way for teams to define their own practices, policies, and team documentation. The leads of each area are responsible for the content of these sections.

:::{admonition} Authority can be delegated outside of the team compass!
If an external space is a better location for information, add a short sentence delegating authority over a particular topic externally. For example, the [review and merge policy](#development:merge-policy) is delegated to the [`/infrastructure` repository](https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure).
