Does each site also need a specific role that is accountable for the content of the site?

I've listed 'DE' has the (usually) responsible team for the Team Compass while recognizing that it is also a multi team effort.  Team Compass hosts our policies and procedures and describes how we work.  I think DE should be responsible for ensuring the overall structure of the Team Compass is consistent even if separate teams are responsible for the content of different subsections.  I think Team Compass is where our systems of work (who does what, when, and in what order) should live. This will include procedures used within BD for the sales processes, the creation and management of engagements by DE, and the delivery of services by P&S.  

I think the Infrastructure Guide should remain the source of truth of how the platform is managed and maintained while the Team Compass is source of truth on how 2i2c Team coordinate our work. To make it explicit,  consider something like 'Deploy a Hub'. The procedure of how that work gets scheduled and prioritized is described in the Team Compass. The interactions between the community and 2i2c as well as the internal interaction between the 2i2c sub teams are described in the the Team Compass.  The Infrastructure Guide contains the specific instructions and code templates needed to actually get a new hub deployed.  Or consider how we structure Technical Support. The procedure for how a ticket receives and triages a support ticket and how the ticket is assigned would be part of the Team Compass.  A runbook to implement a specific configuration change on a community's hub, which may be an outcome of the support process, is documented in the Infrastructure Guide.  

There is still discussion that needs to be held to resolve between BD and PS when it comes to the Service Guide and the Brochure Site.  If we want to maintain a single source of truth, where would the details of what features and services comprise the different membership tiers live? Where does the pricing information live?  Are the words 'Essential Tier', 'Advanced Tier', 'Premium Tier' something that has meaning within the Service Docs? Or are they exclusively marketing terms developed by BD that link out to a collection of features and services in the Service Guide.  

## Teams are responsible for their area's documentation

_something about how documentation and authority flow downward from the team compass into team areas and their respective documentation._
