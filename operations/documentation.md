## Areas are responsible for their own documentation within the Team Compass

The Team Compass is a special case of documentation, because it's shared across our entire organization. Here are some guidelines for how to think about responsibility and impact of the Team Compass:

- The [Delivery Enablement](#delivery-enablement) team is responsibile for the system and structure of the Team Compass.
- **Organization Wide** sections apply to the entire organization. The Executive Director, [Delivery Enablement](#delivery-enablement), and [People Operations](#people-operations) teams are responsible for these sections, but all team members are encouraged to contribute.
- **Areas of Work** sections are a way for each functional area to define their own practices, policies, and team documentation. The leads of each area are responsible for the content of these sections.
- **Areas outside the team compass** are not considered a source of truth unless a section of the team compass delegates that authority to the external space. For example, the [review and merge policy](#development:merge-policy) is delegated to the [`/infrastructure` repository](https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure).
