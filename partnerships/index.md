# Partnerships

:::{note}
This page will be retired as a result of our organisation's restructuring in Oct 2024.
Key areas of responsibility have been moved into a newly created Product and Services, Business Development and Sales.

Partnerships oversee the strategy and systems that 2i2c uses to sustain itself via partnerships with other communities.
This includes partnerships involving paid contracts, as well as informal and formal collaboration.
