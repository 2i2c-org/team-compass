# Partnerships

:::{warning}
This page will be retired as a result of our organisation's restructuring in Oct 2024.
Key areas of responsibility have been moved into a newly created [Product and Services](../product-and-services/index.md) and [Business Development](../biz-dev/index.md) section.
:::

Partnerships oversee the strategy and systems that 2i2c uses to sustain itself via partnerships with other communities.
This includes partnerships involving paid contracts, as well as informal and formal collaboration.
