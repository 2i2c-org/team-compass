# Workflow for hub service leads

This workflow applies to communities that are interested in joining our community hub service.
For more complex projects or grants, see [](./grants-and-projects.md).

The sections below describe **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)** that bring a community from first contact through to an active contract.

## Service partnership lifecycle

We use common terminology to describe the "phase" of partnership that we have with each community.
These follow a process of `Lead` --> `Prospect` --> `Partner`.

- **`Lead`**: A _Lead_ is a contact with possible interest in a partnership with 2i2c.
  We must answer two questions:
  
  1. Are their needs a good candidate for partnership with 2i2c? (see [](#sales:questions-to-answer))
  2. Are they qualified to set up partnership with 2i2c?

  If the answer to each is *yes*, they become a `Qualified Lead`.
- **`Qualified Lead`**:  Once a lead is _qualified_, our goal is to empower the lead to decide whether to partner with 2i2c.
  We provide them information, answer questions, and have discussions to help them arrive at an answer.

  - If they verbally decide `yes`, then the lead becomes a `Prospect`.
  - If they decide `no`, we close the lead.
- **`Prospect`:** The goal of the `Prospect` phase is to set up the business and service relationship with the future partner.
  This involves two activities:
  
  1. **Business terms** of the partnership are negotiated in the service agreement and accompanying documents
  2. **Technical exchanges** specify the prospect's technical needs so we can provide our engineering team the guidance to set up their service.
  
  The prospect phase ends with an "executed close" when the service agreement is fully signed by all parties in the partnership. 
- **`Partner`:** A _Partner_ is an organization that has a signed agreement with 2i2c/CS&S.

## Lead phase SOPs

### SOP: Hail the Lead

A member of the 2i2c Partnerships Team sends an email to partnerships@2i2c.org requesting `Hail the Lead` action for **contact(s) with email addresses**. This message creates an issue in FreshDesk that will be used to track the lead as it progresses through the arc toward a singed partnership agreement. 2i2c's Partnerships Assistant carries out this action sequence:


1. Send Canned Response "Hail the Lead" from FreshDesk to contact email(s):
   ```
   Hello!

   Thank you for your interest in learning more about 2i2c.

   If you wish to connect for a conversation, I invite you to [schedule a virtual meeting by clicking here](https://calendly.com/colliand/2i2c-30-minute-zoom-meeting). 

   Best regards, 
   2i2c's Partnerships Team
   ```
1. Change `From` field to `partnerships@2i2c.org`.
1. Add cc: partnerships@2i2c.org
1. Confirm canned response includes a meeting invitation with 30 minute Calendly link

### SOP: Create running notes for the lead

A lead confirmed an upcoming meeting with 2i2c. Calendly sends an automatic message with Zoom link to the contact and enters a calendar booking into Partnerships Lead's calendar. Partnerships Lead forwards email with meeting details to partnerships@2i2c.org triggering the following actions script:
 
1. Partnerships Lead specifies that the lead will be tracked under "PartnerX" (usually the name of the partner organization)
2. Create PartnerX folder inside 2i2c Team Drive >> Partnerships >> Agreements >> `PartnerX`
3. Copy 2i2c Team Drive >> Partnerships >> Templates >> [Template] Running Notes into PartnerX folder.
4. Rename [Template] -- Running Notes... to `Running notes -- PartnerX + 2i2c` (with PartnerX replaced by name of partner organization).
5. Replace `PartnerX` by partner name in the title of the running notes document.
6. Set sharing of running notes file (with editor rights) with lead contacts (meeting participants); Send message from Google notifying the availability of the shared running notes file. 


### SOP: Meet with the lead

2i2c Partnerships and Community Teams will develop improved procedures for initial meetings with leads.

## Prospect Phase SOPs

### SOP: Send Draft Contract

A member of 2i2c Partnerships Team sends email to partnerships@2i2c.org requesting `Send Draft Contract` to PartnerX contact email(s). 2i2c's Partnerships Assistant carrys out the following actions script: 

1. In the [Agreements folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1d2N0F0zn3-7wG1FrA_6FHgHtNAyMcJr8), navigate to the folder for the partner you're contracting for (or create a new one if needed) - this step is important for Step 5.
2. Return to the Agreements folder and navigate to the [Templates folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1oRFLPChp8J9GpgWpnalF74752oNh9tt8), and open the [[TEMPLATE] Outbound Services Agreement shortcut](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kPgSddJ_Sob0XcTbkDy5UShIAVKPmm04P9ZLsYiOV20/edit#heading=h.qo34o8p9in1e).
3. In the template document, from the menu bar, select `File > Make a copy`
4. Name the copy appropriately (i.e. `PartnerX + 2i2c/CS&S - Services Agreement YYYY-MM-DD`)
5. Click the box below the word **Folder** and in the pop-up menu, the partner folder you navigated to in Step 1 should appear at the top of the list. Mouse-over it and hit the **Select** button
6. Do not check either of the boxes (re: sharing or copying comments)
7. Click **Make a Copy** - your new agreement will open, and will be filed in the appropriate partner folder.
8. Set sharing of service agreement (with editor rights) with lead contacts
9. Add dated entry "YYYY-MM-DD Sent (Draft) Service Agreement as shared Google doc" to `PartnerX >> Running Notes...` file (create a new one if needed).

+ Answer questions

## When to decide to work with a lead

To decide whether we should continue engaging with a particular lead, we need to know whether they are in-scope for our mission and likely to be able to successfully collaborate with us.
The [`MANIAC-T` framework](https://xxiibrands.com/sales/qualify-your-sales-leads-with-maniac-t/) can be helpful in coming to a decision. Here is a short description of these guideilnes:

* **Money**. Is there a specific amount of money set aside for the project? If they are seeking funding in order to pay for this, what are the details?
* **Authority**. Does the contact have the authority to make a buying decision? Who else will need to be involved in the decision-making process?
* **Need**. What are their clear pain-points with their current infrastructure setup? Do they seem to have a real need for change?
* **Impending Event**. Do they have an upcoming event that is urgent or pressing?
* **Application**. Is their use-case a good fit for 2i2c infrastructure? Would their use-case require major changes to our hubs? Is there a different organization better-suited to help them?
* **Competition**. What alternative options are they considering? e.g., other organizations, internal approaches, or deciding to do nothing?
* **Timeline**. What does the buying process look like for this prospect? E.g., finalizing a contract, or receiving a sub-award.
