## Career Ladders

We take heavy inspiration from two open-source career ladders:
* https://www.engineeringladders.com/
* https://career-ladders.dev/

Both ladders propose different workflows although we can identify some similarities we take advantage of.
We have adapted pieces from both ladders as follows:

1. We use **Axes** and **Levels** as described in the Introduction page at https://www.engineeringladders.com/
2. Our Developer track is based on https://www.engineeringladders.com/Developer.html
3. Our Engineering Manager track is based on https://www.engineeringladders.com/EngineeringManager.html, although we added an additional EM4 level described below.
4. The Tech Lead is a role that can be played by anyone in the team **at different levels**: https://career-ladders.dev/engineering#tech-lead. This is a substantial difference from the dedicated Tead Lead ladder proposed by engineeringladders.com. Our existing [Technology Lead role](./roles/technology-lead.md) represents a Tech Lead with high seniority (D4 and above).
5. We also introduce **steps** for each numbered level as a way to build salary bands and enhance the granularity. It is expected that engineers advance step by step before entering a new level, although a whole-level jump may exist if there are enough reasons to justify it.
6. Steps are evaluated every 6 months for 1-3 levels and every year for 4-7 levels, whereas numbered levels are evaluated every year for 1-3 levels and every 2 years for 4-7 levels.

### Fluency chart for Engineering

Recently, as a way to add more structure around professional development and to help engineers know better about the shared expectations for each other, we have developed a [Fluency chart for Engineering](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-IDEpySWDh5NrxRu8yxPxsj9PRkG1yE9EvXnXQRnb6A/edit#gid=1665179918) based on the ladder we described in the previous section. This is a tool that will help us in the development of professional development plans for each of our engineers.

### Salary bands for Engineeering

We have an [internal and engineering-specific salary bands matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D_-RzXhyWw8jFs7KQQXKVRV4VrmOyXjQni2UTnk1044/edit#gid=1576917309) based on the levels outlined in the carreer ladder.

### EM4

* Evangelizes: researches, creates proofs of concept and introduces new technologies to the team
* Owns: owns the production operation and monitoring of the system and is aware of its SLAs
* Coordinates: manages the team membersâ€™ career, expectations, performance and level of happiness
* Challenges: adjusts the team processes, listening to feedback and guiding the team through the changes
* Team: makes an impact on the whole team, not just on specific parts of it
