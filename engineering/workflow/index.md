# Workflow

This document outlines the delivery workflow for the engineering team.

There are currently two workflows:
1. [The default 2-week iteration process](./default-workflow) (paused)
1. [The hyper-focused 1-week iteration process](./1-week-iteration-workflow) (active)

## Why the need for 'The hyper-focused 1-week iteration process'
This is a derivation of the default workflow and relies on many of its artifacts. It arose in direct response to the need to better support the grant writing process and short-term funding goals identified in our 2024 team retreat.
